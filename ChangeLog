Thu Jun 10 16:39:36 CEST 2004 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htcommon/conf_(lexer.lxx,parser.yxx): applied Gilles' patch (April 22)
      which features:
      - improved error handling, gives file name and correct line number,
        even  if using include files
      - allows space before comment, because otherwise it would just complain
        about the "#" character and go on to parse the text after it as a
        definition
      - allows config file with an unterminated line at end of file, by
        pushing an extra newline token to the parser at EOF
      - parser correctly handles extra newline tokens, by moving this
        handling out of simple_expression, and into simple_expression_list
        and block, as simple_expression must return a new ConfigDefaults
        object and a newline token doesn't cut it (caused segfaults when
        dealing with fix above)
    * htcommon/conf_lexer.cxx: Regenerate using flex 2.5.31.
    * htcommon/conf_parser.cxx: Regenerate using bison 1.875a.

Sat 5 Jun 2004   Lachlan Andrew  <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htdoc/attrs.html.in: regenerated using cf_generate.pl

Sat 5 Jun 2004   Lachlan Andrew  <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

      Prepare docs for release of 3.2.0b6.

Mon Apr 26 15:12:22 2004  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

    * htfuzzy/Soundex.cc (generateKey): Applied Alex Kiesel's fix to prevent

    * htsearch/parser.cc:  Address (but not fix) bug #934739
    If collection->getDocumentRef() on line 889 returns NULL, don't crash.
    I'm still trying to work out why it does return NULL -- I don't think
    it ever should.

    * mistakenly back out previous patch :(

Sun 25 Apr 2004 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htdig/Retriever.{h,cc}, htcommon/defaults.cc, htdoc/FAQ.html:
    Add  store_phrases  attribute.  If it is false, htdig only stores the
    first occurrence of each word in a document.  This reduces the database
    size dramatically, and slightly increases digging speed.

Sun 25 Apr 2004 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * db/{aclocal.m4,configure,os_abs.c.win32}, STATUS, htdoc/THANKS.html:

    * htsearch/Display.cc: changed (and fixed) the date factor formula as

Fri Mar 12 09:13:28 CET 2004 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * configure.in: removed 'eval' expressions which caused the 'NONE' prefix
      path to be instantiated and the make script to hang

      autoheader (and therefore autoreconf) to correctly work
    * moved manual pages from htdoc to installdir

    * installdir/*.[1,8]: removed man pages (htdig-pdfparser.1, htdig.1,

      htsearch.1, htstat.1, rundig.1, htdigconfig.8)

      htdig.1.in, htdump.1.in, htfuzzy.1.in, htload.1.in, htmerge.1.in, htnotify.1.in,
      htpurge.1.in, htsearch.1.in, htstat.1.in, rundig.1.in, htdigconfig.8.in)

    * installdir/HtFileType: Use mktemp to create safe temp file (bug #901555)

Wed Feb 25 11:14:45 CET 2004 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htdocs/THANKS.html: added Robert Ribnitz to the 'thanks' page and fixed
      Nenciarini's position (it was not in alphabetical order - sorry!).

Wed Feb 25 11:02:37 CET 2004 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * installdir/*.[1,8]: added man pages (htdig-pdfparser.1, htdig.1,

      Robert Ribnitz <ribnitz at linuxbourg.ch> of the Debian Project
    * installdir/Makefile.am: prepared the automake script for correctly
      handling the man pages

Sat 21 Feb 2004 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htsearch/htsearch.cc:
      Back out change of 21 December, as it causes problems with characters
      which *should* be unencded, like  /

    * htdig/Document.cc: Don't hex-decode twice.  (Caused problems with names
      like  file%20name)

    * htdig/Retriever.cc: Test validity of URL value *before* calling
      signature(), as that implictly normalises, and confuses
      limit_normalised vs limit_urls_to

    * htdig/htdig.cc: Remove stale  md5_db  if  -i  specified

    * installdir/htdig.conf: Set  common_url_parts  to contain all strings

      so more compression than using standard strings.

    * htcommon/defaults.cc: Update docs.  Remove default "bad_extensions"
      from  common_url_parts,  and add  .shtml

    * test/t_htdig, test/t_htdig_local: Update self-tests

Tue Feb 3 18:06:38 CET 2004 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

     ignore empty string results for string attributes whenever they are
     defined in the configuration file by the user
   * htdig/Document.cc: fixed bugs in handling the http_proxy,
     http_proxy_authorization, authorization attributes 
   * htlib/Configuration.[h,cc]: added the Exists method in order to query
     whether an attribute's definition is present in the configuration
     dictionary (before it was checked against its string's length which
     prevented empty attributes to be correctly used)
   * these changes fix bug #887552

      Expanded test suite.

    * htcommon/default.cc, htdoc/{hts_temlates,attrs,cf_byname,cf_byprog}.html:
      Explain that max_description{s,_length} don't affect indexing -- only
      text used to fill in template variables.

Mon 12 Jan 2004 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * Very many files:  Fix bug #873965
      Replace C++ style comments with C style comments in all C files, and .h

Mon 12 Jan 2004 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

      Partially address bug #823455.
      Don't complain if config file doesn't end in EOL.
      Should the grammar be fixed not to need EOL?
      Report errors to  stderr,  not  stdout,  as they confuse the web server.

Fri Oct 24 15:30:08 2003  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

    * htsearch/Display.cc: Fix bug #829746. Applied Niel Kohl's fix for this,
      to check if words input given before trying to use it, to avoid NULL
      argument to syslog().

Fri Oct 24 15:15:53 2003  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

    * htsearch/Display.cc: Fix bug #578570. The enddate handling now works

    * htdig/Retriever.[h,cc]: removed 'head_before_get' overriding by
      restoring the code before Oct 21.
    * htdig/Document.[h,cc]: ditto, with the exception of detaching the HEAD
      before GET mechanism from the persistent connections'.
    * htcommon/defaults.cc: improved documentation (even though it needs
      corrections by an english-speaking developer).
    * These changes fix bug #828628

Wed Oct 22 2003 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htsearch/parser.cc: Applied Neal's patch to fix bug #823403
      Documents only added to search list if they were successfully dug.
      Lines 237-238 of htsearch/Display.cc
        if (!ref || ref->DocState() != Reference_normal)
	    continue;
      should now be redundant.  (Left in to be defensive.)

Tue Oct 21 11:04:56 EST 2003 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htdig/Retriever.h: added the 'RetrieverType' enum and an object variable
      for storing the type of dig we are performing (default initial);
    * htdig/Retriever.cc: changed constructor in order to handle the type,
      added some debugging explanation regarding the override of the
      'head_before_get' attribute, added checks regarding an empty
      database of URLs to be updated (set the type to initial).
    * htdig/Document.h: added the attribute 'is_initial' which stores the
      information regarding the type of indexing (initial or incremental)
      we are currently performing. Added access methods (get-and-set-like)
    * htdig/Document.cc: modified the logic of the HeadBeforeGet settings during
      the retrieval phase, in order to always override user's settings in
      an incremental dig and automatically set the 'HEAD' call in this case.
    * htcommon/defaults.cc: modified the default value of 'head_before_get' and a bit
      of its explanation.
    * htnet/HtHTTP.cc: detached the HEAD before GET mechanism to the persistent
      connections one
    * htdig/Server.cc: added one level of debugging to the display of the

Tue Oct 14 11:54:07 EST 2003 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htnet/HtHTTP.cc: add an empty Accept-Encoding header - this inform the
    server that htdig is only able to manage documents that are not encoded
    (if no Accept-Encoding is sent, the server assumes that the client is
    capable of handling every content encoding - i.e. zipped documents with
    Apache's mod_gzip module). Partial fix of bug #594790 (which now becomes a
    feature request)

Mon Oct 13 2003 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htfuzzy/Regex.cc:  Search for regular expression.  (Used to ignore it!)

    * htfuzzy/Speling.cc, htword/{WordList.cc,WordList.h,WordKey.cc,WordKey.h}:

      Gilles pointed out inconsistency with Retriever::IsValidURL().

Sun Oct  5 2003 Lachlan Andrew <lha at users.sourceforge.net>

    * htdig/{Retriever,Server}.cc: Jim Cole's patch to bug #765726.

      the future.

Thu Aug 28 15:11:21 MDT 2003 Neal Richter <nealr at rightnow.com>

    * Changed db/LICENSE file to new LGPL compatible license from Sleepycat
      Software -- Thanks Sleepycat!

    * Reverted to Revision 1.2 or db/mp_alloc.c  The recent changed cuased
      large DB growth.  Strangely the files contained no 'new' data, they were
      just much larger.  Looks like the pages were being flushed too often????

Thu Aug 28 12:41:22 EST 2003 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * global: updated with 'autoreconf -if' (autoconf 2.57, libtool 1.5.0a and

    * db/[config.guess,config.sub,install-sh,ltmain.sh,missing]: added in the
      database directory (this way 'make dist' goes on); I have not been able to
      tell the db/configure script to get the 'top_srcdir' ones (which should be
      the default behaviour). Maybe in the future we'll look for this.

Thu Aug 28 11:53:48 EST 2003 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

    * db/configure.in: changed AC_PROG_INSTALL() to AC_PROG_INSTALL and removed
      AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR; this implies that autotools copies will be made for the
      db directory as well.

      extra ld flag for GCC on solaris systems (a linkage error occurs
      when libstdc++ is not shared)

      Regenerated using cf_generate.pl.

Tue Aug 26 12:25:40 EST 2003 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

   * configure.in: removed AC_FUNC_MKTIME because it may not work properly
     and added default replacement directory (htlib) for future uses

Mon Jul 21 20:54:47 CEST 2003 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

   * htlib/(malloc|error|lstat|stat|realloc).c: added for cross-compiling

	files without (or with unrecognised) extensions are checked by
	the program specfied by the "content_classifier" attribute.

	* htcommon/URL.cc, htcommon/URL.h: Add new configuration attribute
	allow_double_slash to only remove // marks when requested (since

	proxy authorization.

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc: HTTP header Proxy-Authorization is now handled. The
	SetCredentials and SetProxyCredentials methods now make use of the
	Transport::SetHTTPBasicAccessAuthorizationString method, in order to
	write the string for negotiating the access.

	* htlib/HtDateTime.cc (Parse, SetFTime): Added Parse method for
	more flexible parsing of LOOSE/SHORT formats, use it in SetFTime.

Mon Dec 17 06:40:25 CET 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc: check for null pointer of cookie jar

Sun Dec 16 19:55:07 CET 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htnet/Connection.[h,cc]: default constructor is changed and accepts
	a socket value (by default is -1)
	* htnet/HtCookieJar.[h,cc]: added a simple iterator
	* htnet/HtCookieMemJar.[h,cc]: ditto
	* htnet/HtFile: removed the management of modification_time (constructor)
	* htnet/HtHTTP.[h,cc]: constructor with initilization list and without
	a default constructor (the construction is now forced to pass a valid
	connection object). Removed any memory deletion from the destructor.
	The class is now abstract (see the virtual pure destructor).
	* htnet/HtHTTPBasic.cc: creates a Connection object in the initialization
	and the destructor has no responsability
	* htnet/HtHTTPSecure.cc: creates an SSLConnection object in the initialization
	and the destructor has no responsability
	* htnet/HtNNTP.cc: creates a Connection object in the initialization
	and the destructor has no responsability
	* htnet/Transport.[h,cc]: default constructor accepts a pointer to a
	Connection object and the destructor carries out the deletion of it

Thu Dec  6 13:24:30 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* contrib/examples/rundig.sh: Fixed to make use of DBDIR variable,
	and to test for and copy db.words.db.work_weakcmpr if it's there.

Fri Oct 19 11:07:33 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (IsValidURL): Fixed discrepancies in debug
	levels for messages giving cause of rejection, inadvertantly
	changed when regex support added.

Wed Oct 17 15:48:23 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalTransport.h: Added missing class keyword on friend
	declaration.

Tue Oct 16 14:35:16 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/default.cc (external_parsers): Documented external converter
	chaining to same content-type, e.g. text/html->text/html-internal.

Mon Oct 15 22:25:55 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Document.cc, htdig/htdig.cc, htdig/Retriever.cc: Make sure
	setEscaped is called with the current value of
	case_sensitive. Fixes bug pointed out by Phil Glatz.

	* htdoc/htdump.html, htdoc/htload.html: Fixed 3 little typos.

Fri Oct 12 15:11:45 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc (ParseHeader): Show header lines in debugging
	output at verbosity level 3, not 4, for consistency with 3.1.x.

	* htcommon/URL.cc (removeIndex): Fixed to make sure the matched
	file name is at the end of the URL.

Fri Oct 12 10:39:54 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/HtRegexList.cc (setEscaped): Fixed to set compiled flag to
	FALSE when there's no pattern, so match() can detect this condition.
	Fixes handling of empty lists in bad_querystr, exclude_urls, etc.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (IsValidURL): Fixed bad_querystr matching to
	look at right part of URL, not whole URL.

Mon Sep 24 11:47:15 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc (SetRequestCommand): Put If-Modified-Since header
	out in GMT, not local time, and only put it out if existing document
	time > 0.

	* htsearch/parser.cc (perform_phrase): Optimized phrase search handling
	to use linear algorithm with Dictionary lookups instead of n**2 alg.,
	as suggested by Toivo Pedaste.

Tue Sep 18 10:50:40 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdoc/running.html: New documentation on how to run after configuring.
	* htdoc/rundig.html: New manual page for rundig script.
	* htdoc/install.html: Added link to running.html.

	projects. Updated links to contrib and developer site.

Fri Sep 14 22:12:56 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/URL.h: Moved DefaultPort() from private to public for
	use in HtHTTP.cc.

Fri Sep 14 09:25:20 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc (SetRequestCommand): Add port to Host: header when
	port is not default, as per RFC2616(14.23). Fixes bug #459969.

Sat Sep  8 22:15:33 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

        * acconfig.h, include/htconfig.h.in: Add undef for
	ALLOW_INSECURE_CGI_CONFIG, which if defined does about what you'd
	expect. (This is for any wrapper authors who don't want to rewrite
	but are willing to run insecure.)

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc: Only allow the -c flag to work when
	REQUEST_METHOD is undefined. Fixes PR#458013.

Tue Sep  4 18:58:31 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/DocMatch.cc: Add scoring for Quim's new parser
	framework. Only the normal word scoring is currently done, not
	backlink_factor or other "Document" methods.

Fri Aug 31 15:34:28 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/HTML.h, htdig/HTML.cc (ctor, parse, do_tag): Fixed buggy
	handling of nested tags that independently turn off indexing, so
	</script> doesn't cancel <meta name=robots ...> tag. Add handling
	of <noindex follow> tag. Added <> delim. to tag debugging output.
	Fixed a few typos.

Wed Aug 29 10:33:01 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc (url_part_aliases): Added clarification
	explaining how to use example.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

Mon Aug 27 15:05:09 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* installdir/search.html: Add DTD tag for HTML 4 compliance.
	* installdir/htdig.conf: Added .css to bad_extensions default,
	added missing closing ">".
	* htdoc/config.html: Updated with sample of latest htdig.conf and
	installdir/*.html.

Wed Jul 25 22:16:06 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Put new htnotify_* entries in alphabetical
	order. Removed superfluous quotes from htnotify_webmaster example
	(htnotify.cc adds in the quotes).
	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

Tue Jul 24 16:07:01 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Changed references in (no_)page_number_text
	entries from maximum_pages to maximum_page_buttons.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

Tue Jul 24 14:38:22 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdoc/hts_templates.html: Document Quim Sanmarti's URL decoding
	feature for template variables.

Thu Jul 12 14:12:02 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htnet/HtFile.cc (Request): Fixed so it doesn't remove newlines
	from documents, and so it only tries to open mime.types once even
	if the open fails.

Thu Jul 12 11:40:07 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* contrib/conv_doc.pl, contrib/parse_doc.pl: Fixed EOF handling in
	dehyphenation, fixed to handle %xx codes in title made from URL.

	* contrib/doc2html/doc2html.pl, contrib/doc2html/pdf2html.pl,
	contrib/doc2html/swf2html.pl: Fixed to handle %xx codes in URL title.

Wed Jul 11 15:05:47 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (readFile): Added missing fclose() call, and
	debugging message for when file can't be opened.

Wed Jul 11 14:26:28 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (displayParsedFile): Added debugging message
	when file can't be opened.

	* htseach/Display.cc (buildMatchList): Fixed while loop to avoid
	warning.

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main): Fixed handling of syntax error message
	to use String class instead of strdup().

	* htsearch/parser.cc (setError): Added debugging message when error
	is set.

	* htsearch/parser.cc (parse): Fixed not to clear error message after
	it's set.

Sat Jul  7 22:19:18 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* */Makefile.in: Update using current production automake
	(1.4-p4).

	* htfuzzy/Regexp.[cc,h]: Change class name to Regexp to prevent
	further namespace clashes.
	
	* htfuzzy/Fuzzy.c: #include "Regexp.h" now and make sure we create
	the right class when needed.

	* htlib/mktime.c: Change included mktime declaration to mymktime
	to avoid conflict on Mac OS X. (For some reason, autoconf's
	AC_FUNC_MKTIME doesn't work for Mac OS X. So this is a hack in the
	meantime.)

	* htfuzzy/Makefile.am: Rename Regex files. Oops!

Fri Jul  6 18:38:58 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htfuzzy/Regexp.cc, htfuzzy/Regexp.h: Rename Regex class to
	prevent problems on case-insensitive systems.

	* htlib/HtRegexReplaceList.cc, htlib/String.cc, htdig/htdig.cc:
	Change #include of <stream.h> to modern standard of iostream.h.

	* htlib/Configuration.cc (Read): Make sure we never reference a
	negative position when trimming off whitespace.

	* config.guess, config.sub: Update with new versions from GNU to
	recognize various flavors of Mac OS X/Rhapsody.

	* htlib/strptime.cc: Make sure len is initialized.

Fri Jul  6 12:04:52 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/HtRegexList.cc (setEscaped): Fixed a potential problem
	with list building. When we go back a step, we still have to
	compile the new pattern in case it's the last one.

Wed Jul  4 23:39:19 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/URL.cc (parse, ServerAlias): Fixed two problems that
	caused incorrect signatures to be generated.

Wed Jul  4 13:52:54 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* test/document.cc (dodoc), test/url.cc (dourl),
	test/testnet.cc (Retrieve): Fixed up handling of config to match
	David Graff's changes of May 16, and handling of HtHTTPBasic class
	to match Joshua Gerth's changes of Mar 17.

Tue Jul  3 16:20:56 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (GetLocal): Fixed to use URL class on given
	URL, so that default port numbers are stripped off. This was needed
	to allow local fetching of robots.txt.

	* htnet/Connection.cc (ctors, dtor, Assign_Server, Get_Peername),
	htnet/Connection.h: Got rid of strdup stuff, used String class for
	peer & server_name.

	* htnet/Connection.cc (Get_PeerIP): Used unambiguous name for structure.

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc (ctor, dtor): Don't allocate a 2nd Connection, as
	child classes already do this, and set pointer to null when connection
	is deleted, so we don't try to delete it twice. This was messing up
	the heap and causing segfaults. Call Transport::CloseConnection before
	deleting connection.

	* htnet/HtHTTPBasic.cc (dtor), htnet/HtHTTPSecure.cc (dtor),

	* htnet/HtNNTP.cc (dtor): Only delete connection if non-null, & set
	to null after deleting. Call Transport::CloseConnection before
	deleting connection.

	* htnet/Transport.cc (CloseConnection): Don't exit if connection
	pointer is null, as this may be normal when called from destructor.

Fri Jun 29 11:14:36 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

        * htfuzzy/Endings.cc (getWords): Undid change introduced in 3.1.3,
        in part. It now gets permutations of word whether or not it has
        a root, but it also gets permutations of one or more roots that
        the word has, based on a suggestion by Alexander Lebedev.
        * htfuzzy/EndingsDB.cc (createRoot): Fixed to handle words that have
        more than one root.
        * installdir/english.0: Removed P flag from wit, like and high, so
        they're not treated as roots of witness, likeness and highness, which
        are already in the dictionary.

Mon Jun 25 12:50:47 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main): Got rid of last remnants of 'urllist'
	and used the 'l' StringList as was used in the code before, to make
	restrict and exclude handling work properly.

Mon Jun 25 15:52:19 CEST 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc: defined 'urllist' in order to remove the
	compilation error (as Jesse suggested).

Fri Jun 22 16:28:13 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (buildMatchList): Fix date_factor calculation
	to avoid 32-bit int overflow after multiplication by 1000, and avoid
	repetitive time(0) call, as contributed by Marc Pohl.  Also move the
	localtime() call up before gmtime() call, to avoid clobbering gmtime's
	returned static structure (my thinko).

	* htdig/htdig.cc (main): Use .work file for md5_db, if -a given,
	as contributed by Marc Pohl.

	* htcommon/URL.cc (constructURL): Ensure that the _host is set if we
	are constructing non-file urls, as contributed by Marc Pohl.

	* htdoc/THANKS.html: Credit Marc Pohl for patches.

Tue Jun 19 17:14:05 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* README: Bump up to 3.2.0b4, fix note about bug report submissions.

Tue Jun 19 17:01:16 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (setVariables): Fixed handling of
	build_select_lists attribute, to deal with new restrict & exclude
	attributes.

Mon Jun 18 12:16:27 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* configure.in, configure: Fix "hdig" typo in help.

Fri Jun 15 17:57:19 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Noted effect of locale setting on floating
	point numbers in search_algorithm and locale descriptions.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

Fri Jun 15 15:36:51 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl: Fixed to handle new defaults.cc format
	with trailing backslashes.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

Fri Jun 15 14:57:21 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdb/htdb_dump.cc, htdb/htdb_load.cc, htdb/htdb_stat.cc: Added a
	conditional include of <getopt.h> if HAVE_GETOPT_H is defined.

Fri Jun 15 11:25:24 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main), htcommon/defaults.cc,
	htdoc/hts_form.html: two new attributes, used by htsearch, have
	been added: restrict and exclude. They can now give more control
	to template customisation through configuration files, allowing
	to restrict or exclude URLs from search without passing
	any CGI variables (although this specification overrides the
	configuration one).

Fri Jun 15 09:34:23 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main): Changed ridiculously outdated question
	"Did you run htmerge?" to "Did you run htdig?".

Fri Jun  8 11:07:04 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/Display.cc: Add <float.h> header, now needed for RH 7.1.

Thu Jun  7 12:05:09 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* contrib/htdig-3.2.0.spec: Updated to 3.2.0b4.

	* contrib/README: Mention acroconv.pl script.

Thu Jun  7 10:46:19 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (expandVariables): Use isalnum() instead of
	isalpha() to allow digits in variable names, allow '-' in variable
	names too for consistency with attribute name handling.

Wed Jun  6 16:14:06 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* httools/htpurge.cc (main): Added missing "u:" declaration in
	getopt() call.

Wed Jun  6 15:24:04 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* contrib/doc2html/DETAILS, contrib/doc2html/README,
	contrib/doc2html/doc2html.pl, contrib/doc2html/pdf2html.pl,
	contrib/doc2html/swf2html.pl: Update to version 3.0 of doc2html,
	contributed by David Adams <D.J.Adams at soton.ac.uk>.

Wed May 16 11:23:04 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	Added a pile of changes contributed by David Graff
	<phlat at mindspring.com> fixing compilation problems with
	non-gcc/g++ compilers (i.e. Sun's compiler).

	* Makefile.config, db/Makefile.am: Added no-dependencies to
	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS for those not on GNU C/C++

	* configure.in: Changed AM_PROG_YACC to AC_PROG_YACC as autoconf
	and autoreconf both complain that AM_PROG_YACC is not in the
	library.

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc: Removed default parameters as they are
	already declared in the header

	* htcommon/HtConfiguration.cc: Changed some of the loop
	declarations so that Sparc C 4.2 is happy. Removed default
	parameters as they are already declared in the header Moved inline
	ParseString to header where it belongs. Added initialization for
	HtConfiguration::_config static member variable. Added
	implementation of HtConfiguration::config() static class member.

	* htcommon/HtConfiguration.h: Added include for ParsedString.h.
	Added declaration of static member function ::config().
	Added private static member variable _config;.

	htdig/ExternalTransport.cc, htdig/HTML.cc, htdig/Parsable.cc,
	htdig/Plaintext.cc, htdig/Retriever.cc, : 
	Changed to use new global configuration semantics.
	
	* htcommon/conf_parser.yxx: Added a return to yyerror to quiet
	Sparc C 4.2.  Should really return a value here. Is it normal to
	return a YY_something or just -1, 0, ?

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Added line continuation characters at the
	end of all the string lines that did not completed by a quote.

	* htcommon/defaults.h, htdig/htdig.h: Removed extern
	HtConfiguation config in favor of HtConfiguration::config().

	* htlib/ParsedString.cc (get): Use isalnum() instead of isalpha()
	for looking up--allows names that contain digits too.

Sat May  5 20:36:29 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/htString.h (class String): Remove now-obsolete and
	confusing int() casting operator. This was previously used to make
	a string of a certain length. Use String(int) as a ctor instead.

Sat May  5 20:30:18 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htword/WordContext.[h,cc]: Change Initialize to supply a config
	that can be modified (i.e. if we don't have ZLIB_H).

Sat May 5 23:30:55 CEST 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htnet/HtCookieJar.h: ShowSummary, printing cookies (to be derived)
	* htnet/HtCookieMemJar.[h,cc]: ShowSummary, printing cookies

Thu May 3 23:14:14 CEST 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htlib/HtDateTime.[h,cc]: Timestamp format added (used by ht://Check
	for MySQL interfacing) - keeping them equal helps me maintaining
	both of them!

Thu May  3 10:28:56 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/parser.cc (perform_and): Add missing return statement,
	as suggested by Quim Sanmarti.

Fri Mar 30 15:50:42 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/ResultMatch.h, htsearch/ResultMatch.cc (setTitle): Changed
	argument type to char * to fix problem with sort by title not working,
	as reported by Adam Lewenberg.

Fri Mar 30 14:08:51 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Document.h, htdig/Retriever.cc (parse_url): Define and use
	Document::StoredLength() method to get actual length of data
	retrieved and given to md5(), which may be less than original
	length.  Fixes bug reported by Michael Haggerty.

Wed Mar 21 22:22:55 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (generateStars): Add NSTARS variable for
	template output as suggested by Caleb Crome
	<ccrome at users.sourceforge.net> (except here precision is 0). Fixes
	feature request #405787.
	
	* htdoc/hts_templates.html: Add description of NSTARS variable
	above.

	* htlib/HtRegex.cc (set): Make sure we free memory if we've
	already compiled a pattern.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (got_href): Fix bug pointed out by Gilles
	with hopcounts and don't bother to update the DocURL unless we
	have a new doc.

Mon Mar 19 18:00:18 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/URL.cc (URL): Make sure even absolute relative URLs are
	run through normalizePath() as pointed out by Gilles. Allows
	backout of previous fix of #408586, which does extra re-parsing of
	URL.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (Need2Get): Back out change of Mar. 17 for above.

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.[cxx, lxx]: Apply change suggested by Jesse
	to remove empty statements.
	
Mon Mar 19 11:33:25 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtRegexList.cc (setEscaped): Fix assorted bugs, including
	obvious segfault, incorrect creation of limits, and failure to set
	"compiled" flag before return().

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (IsValidURL): Make sure the tmpList is
	cleared before attempting to parse the bad_querystr
	config--otherwise we'll just Add to the end of the list.

Sun Mar 18 14:01:56 CET 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>
 
	* htnet/Transport.[h,cc], htnet/HtHTTP.cc: In order to modularize
	the net code the default parser string for the content-type has
	been added to the Transport class.
	* htdig/Document.cc: modified for the changes above.

Sat Mar 17 16:38:27 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* configure.in, configure, include/htconfig.h.in: Add tests for
	libssl, libcrypto, and ssl.h.

	* htnet/SSLConnection.[cc,h], htnet/HtHTTPBasic.[cc,h],
	htnet/HTTPSecure.[cc,h]: New files. Contributed by Joshua Gerth
	<jgerth at hmsoaps.com>.

	* htnet/Transport.[cc,h], htnet/HtNTTP.cc, htnet/HtHTTP.cc,
	htnet/Connection.h: Changes needed to support SSLConnection class.

	* htdig/Document.cc, htdig/Document.h: Ditto.
	
	* htnet/Makefile.am, htnet/Makefile.in: Add above for compilation.

	* htdoc/THANKS.html: Updated with new contributors.

Sat Mar 17 15:28:20 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htword/WordContext.cc (Initialize): If HAVE_LIBZ or HAVE_ZLIB_H
	are not defined, make sure wordlist_compress is set to false. This
	semi-hack will not be necessary with new mifluz code which does
	not necessary need zlib. Fixes bug #405761.

Sat Mar 17 14:39:17 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/HTML.cc (do_tag): Fixed problems with META descriptions
	containing newlines, returns or tabs. They are now replaced with
	spaces. Fixes bug #405771.

Sat Mar 17 14:26:55 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/HTML.cc (do_tag): Improve handling of whitespace in META
	refresh handling. Fixes bug #406244.

	* htlib/HtRegexList.cc (setEscaped): Make this more efficient by
	building up larger and larger patterns--when we fail, go back a
	step and add the pattern in the next loop. This ensures we have a
	list of the maximum allowable length regexp.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (Need2Get): Add change suggested by Yariv Tal
	to run URLs through the URL parser for cleanup before comparing to
	the visited list. Fixes bug #408586.

Mon Mar 12 13:28:56 2001  Michael Haggerty  <mhagger at alum.mit.edu>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc, htdig/Retriever.h:
	Fixed two off-by-one errors related to Retriever::factor table.

Mon Mar 12 11:25:31 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	will replace existing keys. Fixes report #407940.

Thu Mar 8 15:31:45 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc: removed an unuseful <else>

Tue Mar  6 11:42:10 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/regex.[c,h]: Update with versions from glibc 2.2.2.

Mon Mar  5 13:47:30 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* ltconfig (host_os): Add test to solve problems building C++
	shared libraries on some platforms. Currently should only make
	--enable-shared the default on Linux and *BSD* unless specified
	explicitly by the user.

Mon Mar  5 12:52:57 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/String.cc (operator =): Add fix contributed by Yariv Tal
	<YarivT at webmap.com>, fixed bug #406075.
	
Mon Mar  5 12:06:26 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtRegexList.cc (match): Ignore rearrangement code for the
	moment--may or may not be the culprit for bug #405277, but is a
	start to debugging the problem.

	* htlib/List.[cc,h]: Remove *prev pointer from listnode
	structure and add a *prev pointer to the cursor structure. Saves
	one pointer per item in the list, plus overhead.

Mon Mar  5 11:56:16 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc (bad_extensions): Add .css to ignore CSS docs.

	* htdig/Document.cc (getParsable): Ignore CSS documents -- they
	aren't very useful to parse. Solves bug report #405772.
	
Sun Mar 04 11:32:43 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc: fixed a bug regarding <no header> with persistent
	connections enabled, but head call before the get one disabled.
	Sourceforge.net's bug reference: 405275 - fixed.
	
Sat Mar  3 21:09:55 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* .version: Bump to 3.2.0b4 so snapshots have right versioning.

Thu Mar  1 16:51:09 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* configure.in: Added test for alloca.h, which is needed for the
	regex.c code.

Wed Feb 28 12:54:43 CEST 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: 'disable_cookies' option has been added, with
	  a 'server' scope. By default it is set to 'false'.
        * htdig/Server.h, cc: management of the option above has been enhanced.
	* htnet/HtHTTP.h, cc: now an HTTP connection can disable/enable cookies
	  through the configuration attribute 'disable_cookies'.
        * htdig/Document.cc: management of cookies enabling/disabling is here.
        * Cookies classes: now support the expiration time. Need only the
	  subdomain treatment.

Mon Feb 26 16:37:30 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.lxx: Don't directly call exit(1) on an error
	condition! Seems a harsh problem for an unknown character.

	* htcommon/conf_parser.yxx: Ditto. (Running out of memory is a
	much more fatal condition, of course.)

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.cxx: Regenerate using flex 2.5.4.

	* htcommon/conf_parser.cxx: Regenerate using bison 1.28.
	
Sun Feb 25 19:46:01 CEST 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.h, cc: support for cookies enabled
	* htnet/Makefile.am: files for cookies have been added to make.

Sun Feb 25 19:27:18 CEST 2001 Gabriele Bartolini <angusgb at users.sourceforge.net>

	* htnet/HtCookie.h,cc: class HTTP cookie
	* htnet/HtCookieJar.h,cc: abstract class for managing the
	'jar' of cookies. In this way, we can use different methods
	for the storage of them.
	* htnet/HtCookieMemJar.h,cc: class for managing the 'jar' of
	cookies in memory, without persistent storage (no db or file).
	* Many thanks to Robert LaFerla for his coding on this! Yeah,
	really really thanks Robert! <robertlaferla at mediaone.net>
	

Thu Feb 22 16:43:18 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdoc/ChangeLog, htdig/RELEASE.html, README: Update to roll the
	release of 3.2.0b3.

Thu Feb 22 16:22:05 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main), htsearch/Display.cc (setVariables,
	createURL, buildMatchList), htdoc/hts_form.html,
	htdoc/hts_templates.html: Add Mike Grommet's date range search
	feature.

Mon Feb 19 18:24:42 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htfuzzy/Synonym.cc (createDB): Create database in a temporary
	directory before we move it into place, much like the endings
	code. This should prevent problems when we just append to the DB
	instead of making a new one.

	* htdig/htdig.cc (main): Fix bug discovered by Gilles--htword
	should be initialized *after* we are finished modifying config
	attributes based on flags and unlink with -i.

	* installdir/rundig: Fix bug with calling htpurge with -s option.

Thu Feb 15 11:03:42 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdoc/*.html: Update with 2001 copyrights and various changes
	with the website move for the pending 3.2.0b3 release.

Thu Feb 15 10:41:47 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtRegexList.cc (match): Fix thinko with logic for matching
	and add code to rearrange matching nodes for hopefully better
	performance.

Sun Feb 11 16:42:11 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtRegexList.h, htlib/HtRegexList.cc (class HtRegexList):
	Simple List(HtRegex) object with similar calling conventions to
	HtRegex class. This version is not as sophisticated as it could
	be, but it's not likely to drop objects when reorganizing.

	* htlib/Makefile.[in,am]: Add HtRegexList files to list for
	compilation.

	* htdig/htdig.h, htdig/htdig.cc, htdig/Retriever.cc: Use
	HtRegexList instead of HtRegex for setting escaped values--should
	never fail (since each String item is short).
	
	* htlib/HtDateTime.cc: Put back timezone specs into the output
	formats so we give everything even if we ignore it when reading
	input.

Mon Feb  5 11:47:07 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtDateTime.cc: Remove the timezone specs in the date
	formats--these are not required in the RFCs because many dates are
	in GMT anyway.

Wed Jan 17 08:48:30 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalTransport.cc (Request): Oops, fixed a holdover from
	code borrowed from ExternalParser.cc's fork handling.

Mon Jan 15 23:09:37 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htnet/Connection.cc: Back out previous change--this should not
	in any way be needed since the configure script should set
	FD_SET_T.

	* configure.in, configure: Add more lenient prototyping for
	select() test--now allows "const struct timeval" for compilation
	on BSDI.

	* htdoc/RELEASE.html: Update with Gilles's changes.

	* htdoc/cf_blocks.html: New file describing <server ...></server>
	and <url ...></url> blocks.

	* htdoc/cf_general.html, htdoc/confmenu.html: Refer to the above.
	
Mon Jan 15 17:46:07 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/TemplateList.cc (createFromString), htcommon/defaults.cc:
	Treat template_map as a _quoted_ string list.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

Mon Jan 15 17:40:45 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdoc/hts_templates.html: Add METADESCRIPTION variable.

	* htsearch/Display.cc (displayMatch): Add METADESCRIPTION variable.

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Fix up handling of arguments.

	and command arguments, add wait() call.

Wed Jan 10 19:23:36 2001  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* installdir/rundig: Fix -a handling to move db.words.db.work_weakcmpr
	into place if it exists

Sat Jan  6 21:50:58 2001  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* configure.in: Add checks for <sys/wait.h> and <wait.h> for
	ExternalParser.

	* include/htconfig.h.in: Regenerate using autoheader.

	* configure: Regenerate using configure.
	
	* htnet/Connection.cc: Add definition for FD_SET_T to fix problems
	compiling on BSDI mentioned by Joe.

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc: Use <sys/wait.h> or <wait.h> as
	appropriate. Should fix problems with compiliation mentioned by
	Jesse on HP/UX.

	* README, htdoc/RELEASE.html: Adjust dates for the new year.

	* htdoc/upgrade.html: A few "remaining features" have been implemented.
	
Sun Dec 06 19:46:15 CEST 2000 Gabriele Bartolini <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc: Fixed bug for Read_Line function call in
	ReadChunkedBody method. Many thanks to Robert LaFerla. ;-)

Tue Dec 12 13:24:49 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Fixed to properly handle binary
	output from an external converter.  Fixed some compilation errors.

Tue Dec 12 12:52:14 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Handle parser command string
	as a string list again to allow arguments, build up argv and
	use execv instead of execl.

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Add call to wait for child process,
	to avoid zombie buildup.

Mon Dec 11 23:57:43 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Fix up handling of fds in child
	process, more fault-tolerant handling of pipe or fork errors.

Mon Dec 11 23:30:55 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Fix up handling of creation
	of temporary file, check for proper return code, give error if
	appropriate.

Mon Dec 11 23:19:28 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Lowercase content-types and
	strip off any trailing semicolons, at one last spot.  This reinserts
	code added Sep 11, which was dropped Oct 9, probably inadvertantly
	during mifluz back-out.

Sun Dec 10 15:28:44 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/ExternalTransport.cc: Use fork/exec instead of calling
	popen, which bypasses any shell escape problems.

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc: Ditto, plus use of mkstemp where
	available to pick the filename.

	* configure, configure.in: Check for mkstemp where available.

	* include/htconfig.h.in: Define it as above.

	* htlib/Makefile.am: Omit regex.c from SOURCES--this is included
	when necessary by the configure script. Otherwise this produces
	duplicate declarations, etc.

	* htlib/Makefile.in: Regenerate using automake --foreign.

	* htcommon/URL.cc: Fix bug with ports of 0 showing up in URLs like
	mailto: or other less-common protocols.

Fri Dec  1 14:45:33 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* contrib/htdig-3.2.0.spec: Updated to 3.2.0b3.

Fri Dec  1 13:59:09 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/Makefile.am: Fix pkginclude_HEADERS to list missing headers
	ber.h, libdefs.h, myqsort.h, mhash_md5.h, omit unneeded langinfo.h;
	fix libht_la_SOURCES to list missing sources regex.c, myqsort.c.

	* htlib/Makefile.in: Regenerate using automake --foreign

	* htlib/langinfo.h, htlib/nl_types.h: Removed as they're now unused.

Fri Dec  1 13:22:47 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/strptime.cc (mystrptime): make ptr const and use cast on
	return value to avoid warnings.

	* htlib/Makefile.am: Fix pkginclude_HEADERS to list HtRegexReplace*.h
	rather than .cc.

	* htlib/Makefile.in: Regenerate using automake --foreign

Fri Dec  1 11:58:21 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	after fixing bug with cp -pr in automake.

Thu Nov 30 14:41:58 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdoc/Makefile.am: Removed howitworks.html from EXTRA_DIST.

	* Makefile.in (distdir): Added missing variable name 'd' to cp -pr.

Thu Nov 30 14:01:48 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/strptime.cc, htlib/lib.h: make first 2 args to strptime
	const to avoid warnings, use cast in asizeof to avoid warnings.

	* htsearch/qtest.cc: Change include from iostream to iostream.h

	* htsearch/DocMatch.cc: Change include from iostream to iostream.h

	* htsearch/Display.cc (createURL, buildMatchList, excerpt, hilight):
	Clean up code to get rid of warnings, especially resulting from
	NULLs in ternary operators.

Thu Nov 30 10:55:09 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/String_fmt.cc (form, vform): Use vsnprintf rather than
	vsprintf, for buffer overflow prevention if vsnprintf available.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc: Remove unused strptime declaration.

	* htlib/HtDateTime.cc: Use mystrptime if HAVE_STRPTIME not set.

Wed Nov 29 23:31:10 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdb/htdb_stat.cc, htdb_load.cc, htdb_dump.cc: Make sure we
	include htconfig.h to include proper declarations.

	* htlib/strptime.cc: Change to strptime.cc, from htdig-3.1 series
	hopefully more portable until I can find a more suitable
	replacement.

	* htlib/Makefile.am, htlib/Makefile.in: As above.

	* htlib/clib.h, htlib/lib.h: Ditto.

	* htdoc/all.html: Add a first draft of program summaries.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (parse_url): Remove undeclared "dup" variable,
	add missing calls to words.Skip().

Wed Nov 29 17:44:56 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	out of while statement for AIX xlC compiler.

Mon Oct 30 21:50:02 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Server.h, htdig/Server.cc (push): Add newDoc paramter that
	will allow redirects (old docs) to be followed and not count
	against the maxDoc restrictions.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (got_redirect): Use new parameter so we don't
	count against a server's max documents since it's a redirect.

	* htlib/nl_types.h: Add for systems missing this header file.

Sun Oct 29 21:36:51 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Updated per-server and per-URL fields to
	match code. I still have a "wish list" of additional attributes
	that should work this way eventually.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

Sun Oct 22 17:13:08 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/HtWordList.h: Add missing include for stdlib.h needed for
	abort().

	* htsearch/BooleanQueryParser.cc (ParseAnd): Fix problems with RH7
	compiler -- shouldn't use "not" as a variable name!

Thu Oct 19 22:19:16 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* ltmain.sh, ltconfig: Update with versions from libtool
	1.3.5. which may fix some problems building libraries.

Mon Oct  9 21:59:11 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* */* [many, many files]: Backed out mifluz merge by going back on
	modified files to 091000 snapshot.

	* configure: Regenerated from configure.in.

	* */Makefile.in: Regenerated using automake.

Fri Oct  6 11:03:14 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/HTML.cc (do_tag): Parse <object> tags properly, looking
	for data= attribute rather than src=.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc (server_aliases): Additional clarification
	to server_aliases description of port numbers.

Wed Oct  4 12:12:31 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	server_max_docs, server_wait_time): Added clarification
	to server_aliases description. Changed word "directive" to
	"attribute" where appropriate. Added cross-link to server_aliases
	from limit_normalized.

Wed Sep 27 00:05:41 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdb/mifluz[dict, dump, load].cc, htdb/util_sig.h,
	htdb/util_sig.cc: New files from mifluz merge. (Whoops, missed a
	directory).

	* htdb/*.cc: Change config.h references to htconfig.h.

	* htlib/myqsort.c: Ditto.

	* htcommon/HtWordReference.h, htcommon/HtWordReference.cc: Ensure
	we keep the WordContext object around--unfortunately this also
	requires that callers initialize us with a WordContext (e.g. from
	the HtWordList class).
	
	* htlib/StringMatch.h, htlib/StringMatch.cc: Changes to use
	WordType directly instead of HtWordType.

	* htfuzzy/*: Ditto. Additionally make sure HtWordReference objects

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.cc, htcommon/HtWordList.cc: As above.

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc, htsearch/qtest.cc: Ditto.

	* htfuzzy/htfuzzy.cc: Ditto.

	method, so just pass along the calls.
	
	* htlib/DB2_db.cc (db_init): Remove unnecessary NULL parameter.

	* htlib/Makefile.am, htlib/Makefile.in: Remove HtVectorGeneric and
	derived files as well as HtWordType as these are depreciated.

Wed Sep 20 22:47:01 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* aclocal.m4: Add in missing autoconf macros that somehow didn't
	make the merge before. (No idea why I didn't catch this earlier.)

	* acinclude.m4: Use newer CHECK_ZLIB macro.
	
	* */Makefile.in: Updated with automake for new build changes.

	* configure, include/htconfig.h.in: Updated using autoconf.

	* configure.in, configure, acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, acconfig.h,
	include/htconfig.h.in: Merged with mifluz versions. Main

	environment (with db/ run through top-level configure).

	* db/*.c: Updated to use htconfig.h instead of config.h.

Wed Sep 13 22:05:33 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* Merged in mifluz-0.19 branch. Everything will break
	temporarily. Loic and I will clean up tomorrow.

	* htdoc/RELEASE.html, htdoc/THANKS.html, htdoc/TODO.html: Get a
	start on updting these files for the next release.

	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl: Revert change of Sep. 9 to ignore links to
	all.html in cf_byprog.html file.

	OperatorQuery.h OrFuzzyExpander.h OrQuery.h OrQueryParser.h
	PhraseQuery.h Query.h QueryCache.h QueryLexer.h
	QueryParser.h SimpleLexer.h SimpleQueryParser.h VolatileCache.h.
	This is the new query parsing/evaluation framework.

	* Modified DocMatch.{cc,h} and ResultList.{cc,h} for compatibility.

	* Removed the previous {And,Or,Exact,}ParseTree.{cc,h} files.

	* Modified Makefile.{am,in} consequently.

Mon Sep 11 11:56:44 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Lowercase content-types and
	strip off any trailing semicolons, at one last spot which Geoff missed. 

Sat Sep  9 21:28:29 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Document.cc (getParsable): Fix a bug with earlier
	change--if no parser is found and the MIME type is not text/* then
	return a NULL parser.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (RetrievedDocument): If a NULL parser is
	returned, mark the document as noindex and move on.

	* configure.in, configure (enable-tests): Fix bug that would run 
	the 'yes' program inside the configure script if --enable-tests 
	was set.

Sat Sep  9 17:50:11 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Add "all" program listing for common
	attributes--seems more logical esp. now with many httool programs.

	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl (cf_byprog): Do not output a link when
	'prog' is 'all.'

	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

	* aclocal.m4 (AM_CHECK_YACC): New macro to check for bison/yacc
	and use "missing yacc" if not found.

	* configure.in (enable_tests): Fix buglet where --enable-tests=no
	or --disable-tests would not work and set the default to enabled
	tests. Since the tests do not build unless the user does a "make
	check" this should not be confusing and should help debugging.
	Also use AM_CHECK_YACC instead of AC_CHECK_YACC.

	* configure: Regenerate using autoconf.

Sat Sep  9 11:01:03 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (canParse): Lowercase content-types and
	strip off any trailing semicolons. Should prevent problems with
	combined content-type; charset values.
	(ctor): As above.

	* htdig/Document.cc (getParsable): Only assume plain text if MIME
	code starts with text/. Should prevent problems with retrieving
	things like image/png or application/postscript as text.

	address and allow customization of notification messages by
	reading in header/footer text as designated by the new attributes
	above.

Fri Sep  8 15:15:00 2000  Quim Sanmarti <qss at gtd.es>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc, htdig/Server.cc: Fix compiler warnings about
	String conversions.

	* configure, configure.in, db/configure, db/configure.in,
	db/acinclude.m4, db/aclocal.m4: Ensure --enable-bigfile is handled
	correctly by the configure scripts as pointed out by Jesse.

	Server classes. This change made me do lots of changes in other files:
	HtFile.cc, HtHTTP.cc, HtConfiguration.*, Document.*, ExternalParser.*,
	Retriever.*.

Tue Aug 30 12:00:00 2000  Toivo Pedaste <toivo at ucs.uwa.edu.au>

	a page and also optionally the modify date.

	* htlibs/mhash_md5.h, htlibs/mhash_md5.c, htlibs/libdefs.h:

	Rewrote using new WordToken inherited method. Fixes a bug where
	user input two phrases next to each other.

	"adsorb" prior query words. Also fix bug where operators were
	incorrectly popped off the stack. Should (hopefully) solve all
	parsing problems.

	* htsearch/*ParseTree.cc (GetLogicalWords): Test for empty list of
	children to prevent potential segfault.

Sat Aug 26 18:40:50 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* installdir/{syntax, header, footer, wrapper, nomatch}.html: 
	Add DTD tags, ALT attributes and remove bogus </select> tags to
	fix invalid HTML pointed out in PR#901.

Wed Aug 23 23:39:18 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/ParseTree.cc (Parse): Get rid of compiler warnings, use
	new private tokenizer to ensure parens and quote aren't
	removed. Also, when popping an operator off the parens stack, make
	sure it's adopted by a new ParseTree object so we get the parens
	back in the tree heirarchy.

Wed Aug 23 23:34:44 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/AndParseTree.cc (Parse): Fix nasty infinite loop when

Sun Aug 20 23:25:01 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* httools/htpurge.cc (purgeDocs): Add error message when document
	database is completely empty. Should take care of PR#672 (and others).

Sun Aug 20 20:37:53 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtRegex.h, htlib/HtRegex.cc: Made destructor virtual,
	added lastError() and associated support. Changed return type of
	set*() to int. They now return the value of |compiled|.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc (url_rewrite_rules): Add new attribute to
	support patch by Andy Armstrong <andy at tagish.com> for permanent
	URL rewriting.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: Reran cf_generate.pl.

	* htlib/HtRegexReplace.cc, htlib/HtRegexReplaceList.cc,

	htcommon/HtURLRewriter.cc, htcommon/HtURLRewriter.h: New classes.

	* htcommon/Makefile.am, htcommon/Makefile.in: Add compilation for
	HtURLRewriter.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (got_href): Rewrite the URL before we do
	anything with it.

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.lxx: Patched to fix the bug with relative
	filename includes. Keeps a separate stack with the filenames and
	adjusts accordingly.

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.cxx: Updated using flex 2.5.4.

Thu Aug 17 23:59:26 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.lxx: Patched to fix a bug reported by Abel
	Deuring -- config filename stack was decremented too many times.

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.cxx: Updated using flex 2.5.4.
	
Thu Aug 17 23:40:08 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htword/WordType.h (WordToken): Add non-destructive version of
	HtWordToken using a passed int as a pointer into the
	string. Add virtual destructor so class can be sub-classed.

	* htword/WordType.cc (WordToken): Implement it.

	* httools/htmerge.cc (mergeDB): Back out change of Aug. 9th --
	WordSearchDescription has disappeared from htword
	interfaces. Should be restored when Loic comes back and can
	suggest an alternative.

Thu Aug 17 16:59:05 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (createURL): Get rid of extra "config="
	parameter that was inserted before collections stuff.

Thu Aug 17 15:47:58 CEST 2000 Gabriele Bartolini <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc: ask again for a document after a <NoHeader>
	response is given by the HTTPRequest() method.

Thu Aug 17 12:25:33 CEST 2000 Gabriele Bartolini <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htnet/HtHTTP.*, htnet/Transport.* : fixed bug with HTTP/1.1 management.
	Now the "Connection: close" directive is handled and force the connection
	to be closed. So the bug has now been fixed. Fixed other minor bugs and
	strings initializations.
     
Tue Aug 15 00:24:33 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* contrib/multidig/Makefile, gen-collect, db.conf, multidig.conf:
	Add missing trailing newlines as pointed out by Doug Moran
	<dmoran at dougmoran.com>.

Fri Aug 11 16:03:18 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (setVariables), htcommon/defaults.cc: Added
	maximum_page_buttons attribute, to limit buttons to less than
	maximum_pages.  Fixes PR#731 & PR#781.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: reran cf_generate.pl

Wed Aug  9 23:04:39 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	documents when you merge a database with a copy of itself
	contributed by Lorenzo.

Wed Aug  9 22:58:39 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/parser.cc (score): Merged in patch contributed by
	Lorenzo Campedelli <lorenzo.campedelli at libero.it> and Arthur
	Prokosch <prokosch at aptima.com> to fix problems with AND operators
	and phrase matches.

	* htsearch/Display.cc (setVariables), htcommon/defaults.cc: Enhanced
	build_select_lists attribute, to generate not only single-choice
	select lists, but also select multiple lists, radio button lists
	and checkbox lists. Added explanation and examples in documentation.
	* htdoc/hts_selectors.html: Added detailed explanation of new feature.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: reran cf_generate.pl

Tue Aug  1 21:50:22 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/ParseTree.cc (Parse): Fix problems with token
	comparisons and fix thinko with HtWordToken parsing--previously
	didn't advance the parse step at all.

	* htsearch/*ParseTree.cc (Parse): Fix thinko with HtWordToken as
	above--here it acted as an infinite loop.

	* htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Add shell quoting around
	content-type. Hard to exploit, but a server could potentially
	return a strange value that could then be exectuted locally.

Thu Jun 29 23:33:51 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/ParseTree.h, htsearch/ParseTree.cc: New parent class
	for the new htsearch framework. Still needs work.

	* htsearch/*ParseTree.*: Derived classes appropriate to the method
	indicated.

	* htsearch/parsetest.cc: New program to alllow initial
	command-line testing of ParseTree classes.

	* htsearch/Makefile.am, htsearch/Makefile.in: Build parsetest in
	addition to htsearch. Eventually, parsetest is probably best
	modified slightly and moved into the tests directory.

Tue Jun 20 22:29:57 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* httools/htmerge.cc (mergeDB): Merge in patch contributed by
	Lorenzo Campedelli <lorenzo.campedelli at libero.it> to greatly
	reduce memory usage.

Sun Jun 18 13:15:43 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/Object.h (class Object): Fix problems with retrieval order
	by insuring the compare() method is declared const.

Tue Jun 13 22:57:10 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (GetLocal): Fix bug that would cause a
	coredump when local_urls was used and local_default_docs was
	needed. The list of default filenames was freed before it should
	have been.

Tue Jun 13 19:30:28 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/HtWordReference.h, htcommon/HtWordReference.cc (Load,
	LoadHeaders): New methods to check the header of an ASCII
	representation and read it in.

	* htcommon/HtWordList.h, htcommon/HtWordList.cc (Load): Add load
	method to read in data. Calls the new methods above.

	* httools/htload.cc: Open word databases read-write and call

	== minScore as reported by Rajendra. Fixed problem PR#858.
	(displayMatch): Ditto.

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc: Fix memory corruption problem in reporting
	syntax errors pointed out by Rajendra. Fixes PR#860.

	* htfuzzy/Accents.h, htfuzzy/Accents.cc: Apply Robert Marchand's
	  patch to his algorithm.  Gets rid of writeDB function (falls back
	  on default one in Fuzzy.cc), changes addWord, and adds a new
	  getWords function to override default.  These avoid overhead of
	  unaccented forms of words in accents database, but ensure that
	  unaccented form of search word is always searched.

Thu Jun  8 09:00:02 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.h(DocScore, docScore),
	  htsearch/ResultMatch.cc(ScoreMatch::compare),
	  htsearch/ResultMatch.h(setScore, getScore, score),
	  htsearch/Display.cc(displayMatch, generateStars, buildMatchList):
	  Apply Terry Luedtke's patch for score calculations, to calculate
	  min & max from log(score).

Thu Jun  8 08:47:03 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* contrib/doc2html/doc2html.pl: Apply David Adams' fix for missing
	  quote.

Wed Jun 07 10:53:53 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* db/db.c (CDB___db_dbenv_setup): open mode is 0666 instead
	  of 0 otherwise the weakcmpr file is not open with the proper
	  mode.

Tue Jun  6 23:48:48 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* httools/htpurge.cc: Fix coredump problems by passing
	dictionaries as pointers rather than full objects (this is
	preferred anyway).

Sun Jun  4 22:17:14 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* test/t_htdig_local: Added test for local filesystem support.

	* test/config/htdig.conf2.in: Change to be a config file for
	local_urls testing.

	* test/Makefile.am: Add t_htdig_local to list.

Tue May 30 23:52:45 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* httools/htmerge.cc: Move to httools directory, remove "cleanup"
	functionality now in htpurge and merge in htmerge.h and db.cc files.
	
	* httools/Makefile.am: Add htmerge now moved to this directory.

	* */Makefile.in: Update with automake.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove htmerge, now found in httools.

	htdump and update path for htmerge.

	* test/t_htdig: Change htmerge to htpurge to clean out incorrect URLs.

	* installdir/rundig: Change htmerge to htpurge. This needs serious
	additional cleanup for use in 3.2 since many conventions have changed!

Tue May 23 22:21:14 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* README: Fix for 3.2.0b3 and clean up organization a bit for new
	directory structure.

Wed May 17 23:22:31 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/HTML.cc (do_tag): Add support for TITLE attributes in
	anchor and related tags.

Fri May 12 17:54:09 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* db/acinclude.m4: bigfile support is disabled by default.

	* db/mp_region.c (CDB___memp_close): clear weakcmpr pointer
	  when closing region so that memory pool files are not 
	  released twice.

Wed May 10 22:26:21 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* */*.cc: all include htconfig.h

	* htlib/HtTime.h: remove htconfig.h inclusion (never in headers)

	* htlib/*.h,*.cc: Fix copyright GNU Public -> Gnu General Public
	  and 1999, 2000 instead of 1999.

Tue May 09 16:38:07 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htsearch/Collection.cc (Collection): set searchWords and 
	  searchWordsPattern to null in constructor. Delete in destructor.
	  Also delete matches in destructor.

	* test/word.cc (doskip_harness): free cursor after use.

	* test/word.cc (doskip_overflow): free cursor after use.

	* test/dbbench.cc (find): free cursor after use.

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main): free searchWords and searchWordsPattern
	  after usage.

	* htdb/htdb_{load,dump,stat}.cc (main): call WordContext::Finish
	  to free global context for inverted index.

	* htdb/htdb_stat.cc (btree_stats): free stat structure.

	* htlib/List.h (class List): Add Shift/Unshift/Push/Pop methods.

	* htlib/List.h (class List): Add Remove(int position) method.

Tue May 09 00:22:33 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main): kill useless call to 
	  StringList::Release

	* htsearch/HtURLSeedScore.cc (ScoreAdjustItem): remove useless
	  call to StringList::Destroy.
	
	* htlib/HtWordCodec.cc (HtWordCodec): Fix usage of StringList
	  that was inserting pointers to volatile strings instead of
	  permanent copies. I suspect that the tweak on StringList was
	  primarily done to satisfy this piece of code. After reviewing
	  all the usage of StringList, it's the only one to use it in this
	  fashion.

	* htlib/QuotedStringList.h (class QuotedStringList): remove
	  noop destructor to enable Destroy of the underlying StringList
	  when deleted.

Mon May 08 18:17:02 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htlib/StringList.h (class StringList): change methods 
	  Add/Insert/Assign that were copying the String* given in argument.
	  This behaviour is confusing since it has a different semantic
	  than the base class List.

Mon May 08 17:16:00 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (GetLocal): fix leaked defaultdocs

Mon May 08 04:27:47 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htlib/StringList.cc (Create): remove SRelease. Deleting
	  the strings is taken care of by the destructor thru 
	  Destroy. If destruction of the Strings is not desirable
	  Release should be used. SRelease was added apparently after
	  a virtual constructor doing nothing was added to hide the
	  default call to Destroy therefore leaking memory. 

Mon May 08 01:28:25 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* test/txt2mifluz.cc,word.cc,search.cc: fix minor memory leaks.

Sun May 07 19:24:12 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* Makefile.config (HTLIBS): add libht at end because htdb
	  now depends on htlib.

	* configure.in,htlib/Makefile.am: use LTLIBOBJS as suggested
	  by the libtool documentation.

Sun May 07 17:09:22 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* test/Makefile.am (clean-local): clean conf to prevent
	  inconsistencies when re-configuring in a directory that
	  is not the source directory.

Sun May 07 05:07:23 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* db/mkinstalldir,test/benchmark: Add for installation purpose

Sun May 07 02:17:03 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* Makefile.am (distclean-local): Xtest instead of test 
	  that confuse some shells.

Sun May 07 02:02:46 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htword/WordDB.cc: Move Open to WordDB.cc.

Sun May 07 01:32:47 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* test/t_*: check/fix scripts. All regression tests pass
	  on RedHat-6.2.

Sun May 07 00:54:30 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* */*.cc: fix warnings and large file support inclusion
	  files on Solaris.

Sat May 06 21:55:58 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* test/: import regression tests from mifluz
	
	* htlib/DB2_db.cc (db_init): fix flags used when creating the
	  environment to include a memory pool.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: change wordkey_description format.
	  update all wordlist_* attributes

Sat May 06 04:46:03 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htmerge/words.cc (mergeWords): WordSearchDescription becomes
	  WordCursor.

	* httools/htpurge.cc (purgeWords): WordSearchDescription becomes
	  WordCursor.

Sat May 06 02:01:40 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at senga.org>

	* htdb/*: upgrade to Berkeley DB 3.0.55. Very different.

	* htlib/getcwd.c,memcmp.c,memcpy.c,memmove.c,raise.c,snprintf.c,
	strerror.c,vsnprintf.c,clib.h: Add compatibility support

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc (LoadDB): remove unused variable

	* htlib/DB2_db.cc: adapt to Berkeley DB 3.0.55 syntax.

	* htlib/Database.h (class Database): remove DB_INFO, does
	  not exist in Berkeley DB 3.0.55

	* htlib/*: run ../db/prefix-symbols.sh

	* Makefile.config (INCLUDES): fix db include dirs

	* acconfig.h: Big file support + replacement functions 

	* acinclude.m4,configure.in : db instead of db/dist + bug fixes

Fri May  5 08:33:59 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* db/*: Merge in changes from Loic's mifluz tree. This will break
	everything, but Loic promises he'll fix it ASAP after I make this
	change.

Mon Apr 24 21:58:22 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/htdig.cc (main): Make the -l stop & restart mode the
	default. This will catch signals and quit gracefully. The
	command-line parser will still accept -l, it will just ignore it.
	(usage): Remove -l portion.
	(main): Fix -m option to read in a file as it's
	supposed to do! Also set max_hops correctly so really only indexes
	the URLs in that file.
	
	* htdoc/htdig.html: Remove -l from documentation since it's now
	the default.

Mon Apr 24 21:22:53 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Server.cc (push): Fix bug where changes in the robots.txt
	would be ignored. If a URL was indexed and later the robots.txt
	changed to forbid it, the URL would still be updated.

Wed Apr 19 22:13:02 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* Merging in changes from mifluz 0.14 from Loic.

	* htlib/Configuration.cc (Read): Removed dependency on fstream.h,
	use fopen, fprintf, fgets, fclose instead of iostream.

	* htlib/HtPack.cc, htlib/HtVectorGeneric.h, htlib/Object.h,
	htlib/ParsedString.cc, htlib/String.cc: Remove use of cerr,
	instead use fprintf(stderr ...).

	* htlib/Dictionary.cc, htlib/HtVectorGeneric.cc, htlib/List.cc,
	htlib/Object.cc, htlib/StringList.cc, htlib/htString.h,
	htlib/strcasecmp.cc: Add #ifdef blocks for htconfig.h

Wed Apr 12 19:09:40 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* .version: Bump to 3.2.0b3.

	* htdoc/htload.html, htdoc/htpurge.html, htdoc/htstat.html: Fix
	typos in headers.

	* htdoc/main.html: Fix link to download to actually point to 3.2.0b2.

Tue Apr 11 00:21:48 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (setupWords): Does not apply fuzzy
	algorithms to phrase queries. This helps prevent the infinite
	loops described on the mailing list.

	* htcommon/conf_parser.yxx (list): Add conditions for lists
	starting with string-number, number-string, and number-number.

	* htcommon/conf_parser.cxx: Regenerate using bison.
	
	* htdoc/RELEASE.html: Update release notes for recent bug fixes
	and likely release date for 3.2.0b2.

	* htdoc/main.html: Add a blurb about the 3.2.0b2 release.

	* htdoc/*.html: Remove author notes in the footer as requested by
	Andrew. To balance it out, the copyright notice at the top links
	to THANKS.html.

Sun Apr  9 15:21:12 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/conf_parser.yxx (list): Fix problem with
	build_select_lists--parser didn't support lists including numbers.

	* htcommon/conf_parser.cxx: Regenerate using bison.

Sun Apr  9 12:53:02 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdoc/RELEASE.html: Add a first draft of 3.2.0b2 release notes.

	compilation list.

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.h: Add optional verbose options to DumpDB
	and LoadDB.
	
	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc (LoadDB): Implement loading and parsing
	an ASCII version of the document database. Records on disk will
	replace any matching records in the db.
	(DumpDB): Add all fields in the DocumentRef to ensure the entire
	database is written out.

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.h: Add new method for setting DocStatus
	from an int type.

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.cc (DocStatus): Set it using a switch
	statement. (It's not pretty, but it works.)
	
	* httools/htload.cc: New file. Loads in ASCII versions of the
	databases, replacing existing records if found.

	* httools/htdump.cc: Pass verbose flags to DumpDB method. Make
	sure to close the document DB before quitting.

	* httools/htpurge.cc: Add -u option to specify a URL to purge from
	the command-line.

	* httools/htstat.cc: Add -u option to output the list of URLs in
	the document DB as well.

Sat Apr  8 16:35:55 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Change all <b>, <i>, and <tt> tags to the
	HTML-4.0 compliant <strong>, <em>, and <code> tags.

	* installdir/long.html, installdir/header.html,
	installdir/nomatch.html, installdir/syntax.html,
	installdir/wrapper.html: Ditto.

	* htdoc/*.html: Ditto. (Don't you just love sed?)

	* htsearch/TemplateList.cc (createFromString): Ditto.
	
	* htdoc/htpurge.html, htdoc/htdump.html, htdoc/htload.html,
	htdoc/htstat.html: New files documenting usage of httools

	* htdoc/htdig.html: Update table with -t format to match htdump.

Fri Apr  7 00:30:01 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* README: Update to mention 3.2.0b2 and use correct copyright. (It
	is 2000 after all!)

	* htdoc/FAQ.html, htdoc/where.html, htdoc/uses.html,
	htdoc/isp.html: Update with most recent versions from maindocs.

	* htdoc/RELEASE.html: Add release notes for 3.1.5 to the
	top. (It's out of version ordering, but it is in correct
	chronological order.)

Fri Apr  7 00:11:29 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* httools/htpurge.cc (main): Read in URLs from STDIN for purging,
	one per line. Pass them along to purgeDocs for removal. Also, make
	discard_list into a local variable and pass it from purgeDocs to
	purgeWords.
	(purgeDocs): Accept a hash of URLs to delete (user input) and
	return the list of doc IDs deleted.
	(usage): Note the - option to read in URLs to be deleted from STDIN.

Thu Apr  6 00:10:23 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (got_redirect): Allow the redirect to accept
	relative redirects instead of just full URLs.

Wed Apr  5 15:07:52 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc: Added #if test to make sure DBL_MAX is
	defined on Solaris, as reported by Terry Luedtke.

Tue Apr  4 12:46:37 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	plural_suffix.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:
	Regenerate using cf_generate.pl.

Fri Mar 31 21:48:02 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* configure.in, configure: Add test using AC_TRY_RUN to compile
	against the htlib/regex.c and attempt to compile a regexp. This
	should allow us to find out if the included regex code causes
	problems.

	* acconfig.h: Add HAVE_BROKEN_REGEX as a result of the configure
	script to conditionally include the appropriate regex.h file.

	* include/htconfig.h.in: Regenerate using autoheader.

	* htlib/regex.c: Move #include "htconfig.h" inside HAVE_CONFIG_H
	tests. This file is only created when this is true anyway. This
	prevents problems with the configure test.
	
	* htlib/HtRegex.h, htfuzzy/EndingsDB.cc: Use HAVE_BROKEN_REGEX
	switch to use the system include instead of the local include
	where appropriate.

	* htlib/Makefile.am, htlib/Makefile.in: Only compile regex.lo if
	the configure script added it to LIBOBJS.

Thu Mar 30 22:41:38 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/URL.cc (normalizePath): Remove Gilles's loop to add
	back ../ components to a path that would go above the top
	level. Now we simply discard them. Both are allowed under the RFC,
	but this should have fewer "surprises."

Tue Mar 28 21:57:49 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htnet/Connection.cc (Read_Partial): Fix bug reported by Valdas
	where a zero value returned by select would result in an infinite
	loop.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Add new attribute plural_suffix to set the
	language-dependent suffix for PLURAL_MATCHES contributed by Jesse.

	* htsearch/Display.cc (setVariables): Use it.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:
	Regenerate using cf_generate.pl.

Mon Mar 27 22:28:20 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.cc (Deserialize): Add back stub for
	DOC_IMAGESIZE to prevent decoding errors. This just throws away
	that field.

	* htcommon/HtSGMLCodec.h (class HtSGMLCodec): Differentiate
	between codec used for &foo; and numeric form &#nnn; Make sure
	encoding goes through both but decoding only goes through the
	preferred text form.

	* htcommon/HtSGMLCodec.cc (HtSGMLCodec): When constructing the
	private HtWordCodec objects, create separate lists for the number
	and text codecs.

Mon Mar 27 21:25:27 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/HtURLSeedScore.cc (ScoreAdjustItem): Change to use
	HtRegex for flexibility and to get around const char * -> char *
	problems.

	* htsearch/SplitMatches.cc (MatchArea): Ditto.

	* htsearch/Makefile.am, htsearch/Makefile.in: Add SplitMatches.cc
	and HtURLSeedScore.cc to compilation list!

Mon Mar 27 21:03:12 2000  Hans-Peter Nilsson  <hp at bitrange.com>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc (defaults): Add default for
	search_results_order, url_seed_score.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:
	Regenerated using cf_generate.pl.
	
	* htlib/List.h (List): New method AppendList.
	* htlib/List.cc (List::AppendList): Implement it.

	* htsearch/SplitMatches.h, htsearch/SplitMatches.cc: New.

	* htsearch/HtURLSeedScore.cc, HtURLSeedScore.h: New.

	* htsearch/Display.h (class Display: Add member minScore.
	Change maxScore type to double.

	* htsearch/Display.cc: Include SplitMatches.h and HtURLSeedScore.h
	(ctor): Initialize minScore, change init value for
	maxScore to -DBL_MAX.
	(buildMatchList): Use a SplitMatches to hold search results and
	interate over its parts when sorting scores.
	Ignore Count() of matches when setting minScore and maxScore.
	Use an URLSeedScore to adjust the score after other calculations.
	Calculate minScore.
	Correct maxScore adjustment for change to double.
	(displayMatch): Use minScore in calculation of score to adjust for
	negative scores.
	(sort): Calculation of maxScore moved to buildMatchList.
	
Mon Mar 27 20:22:24 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.h, htcommon/DocumentRef.cc: Remove
	DocImageSize field since it is not used anywhere and is never updated.

	* htdig/Retriever.h (class Retriever): Remove references to Images class.

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc (DumpDB): Ignore DocImageSize field.

	* htdig/Makefile.am, htdig/Makefile.in: Remove Images.cc since
	this is no longer used.

	* htdig/Plaintext.cc: Do not insert SGML equivalents into the
	excerpt, these are decoded by HtSGMLCodec automatically.

Sat Mar 25 21:58:36 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl (html_escape): Changed <b></b> and <i></i>
	tags to HTML 4.0 <strong> and <em> tags.

Sat Mar 25 17:23:46 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdb/Makefile.am, htdb/Makefile.in: Change the names of the htdb
	utility programs to escape name conflicts with httool programs.

	* htdb/htdb_load.cc: Rename htload.cc to escape name conflict and
	more closely match orignal db_load program name.

	* htdb/htdb_dump.cc, htdb/htdb_stat.cc: Ditto.

	* htfuzzy/Prefix.cc (getWords): Add code to "weed out" duplicates
	returned from WordList::Prefix. We only want to add unique words
	to the search list.

Fri Mar 24 22:33:20 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Document.cc (Document): Fix bug reported by Mentos
	Hoffman, contributed by Atlee Gordy <agordy at moonlight.net>.

Mon Mar 20 23:14:26 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc (Delete): Fix bug reported by Valdas
	where duplicate document records could "sneak in" because the
	doc_index entry was removed incorrectly.

Mon Mar 20 19:08:14 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Added block field and added appropriate blocks.

	* htlib/Configuration.h (struct ConfigDefaults): Add block field.

	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl: Parse the new block field.

	* htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html, htdoc/attrs.html:
	Regenerate using above.

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc (DumpDB): Make sure we decompress the
	DocHead field before we write it to disk!

	* httools/htdump.cc, httools/htstat.cc: Call
	WordContext::Initialize() before doing any htword calls.
	
Mon Mar 20 14:10:30 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* httools/htpurge.cc: Whoops! Left some references to htmerge in
	the error messages and usage message.

	* httools/htstat.cc: New program. Simply spits up the total number
	of documents, words and unique words in the databases.

	* httools/htdump.cc: New program. Simply dumps the contents of the
	document DB and the word DB to doc_list and word_dump files
	respectively. Also has flags -w and -d to pick one or the other.

	* httools/Makefile.am, httools/Makefile.in: Add htdump and htstat
	programs to compilation list.
	
	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc (DumpDB): Change name of CreateSearchDB
	and add fields for DocBackLinks, DocSig, DocHopCount, DocEmail,
	DocNotification, and DocSubject. This should now export every
	portion of the document DB.

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.h: Change name of CreateSearchDB and add
	stub for LoadDB, to be written shortly.

	* htdig/htdig.cc: Call DumpDB instead of CreateSearchDB when
	creating an ASCII version of the DB.
	
Sat Mar 18 22:57:02 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* httools/Makefile.am, httools/Makefile.in: New directory for
	useful database utilities.

	* httools/htnotify.cc: Moved htnotify to httools directory.

	* httools/htpurge.cc: New program--currently just purges documents
	(and corresponding words) in the databases. Will shortly also
	allow deletion of specified URLs.

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Remove htnotify directory in favor of
	httools directory.

	* configure: Regenerate using autoconf.

	* Makefile.in: Regenerate using automake --foreign.

Fri Mar 17 16:47:37 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (excerpt, hilight): Correctly handle case
	where there is no pattern to highlight.
	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (addRequiredWords), htcommon/defaults.cc:
	Add any_keywords attribute, to OR keywords rather than ANDing,
	fix addRequiredWords not to mess up expression when there are
	no search words, but required words are given.
	* htdoc/hts_form.html: Mention new attribute, add links to all
	mentioned attributes.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:
	Regenerate using cf_generate.pl.

Fri Mar 17 15:48:12 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htfuzzy/Accents.cc (generateKey): Truncate words to
	maximum_word_length, for consistency with what's found in word DB.

Fri Mar 17 10:56:17 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/HTML.cc (do_tag): Use case insensitive parsing of META
	robots tag content.
	* htlib/String.cc (uppercase): Fix misplaced cast for islower().

Mon Mar  6 17:31:37 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (setupWords): Don't allow comma as string
	list separator, as it can be a decimal point in some locales.

Mon Mar 06 00:58:00 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* db/mp/mp_bh.c (__memp_bhfree): always free the chain, if
	  any. The bh is reset to null after free and we loose the
	  pointer anyway, finally filling the pool with it.

	* db/mp/mp_cmpr.c (__memp_cmpr_write): i < CMPR_MAX - 1 instead of
	  i < CMPR_MAX otherwise go beyond array limits. This fixes a 
	  major problem when handling large files.

	* db/mp/mp_cmpr.c (__memp_cmpr_free_chain): clear BH_CMPR
	  flag. Was causing core dumps, thanks to 
	  Peter Marelas maral at phase-one.com.au for providing 
	  a simple case to reproduce the error.

Fri Mar  3 11:32:34 2000 CEST Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* Fixed bugs regarding yesterday's changes. Even Leonardo da Vinci
	  used to commit errors, so  ...

Fri Mar  3 11:25:42 2000 CEST Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* testnet.cc: added the -r and -w options in order to set how many
	  times it retries to re-connect after a timeout occurs, and how long
	  it should wait after it.

Thu Mar  2 18:45:15 2000 CEST Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htnet/Connection.*: management of wait_time and number of retries

        * htdig/Server.*: Set members for managing timeout retries taken from
          the configuration file ("timeout", "tcp_max_retries", "tcp_wait_time").
          
        * htdig/Document.cc: Added the chance to configure on a server basis
          "persistent_connections", "head_before_get", "timeout",
          "tcp_max_retries", "tcp_wait_time". Changed Retrieve method accepting
          now a server object pointer: Retrieve (server*, HtDateTime).
          
        * htdig/Retriever.cc: Added the chance to configure on a server basis
          "max_connection_requests" attribute.
        
        * htcommon/defaults.cc: Added "tcp_max_retries", "tcp_wait_time" -- Need
          to be go over by someone who speaks english better than me. Not a hard
          work !!! ;-)
        
Wed Mar  1 17:01:09 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (excerpt, hilight): move SGML encoding into
	hilight() function, because when it's done earlier it breaks
	highlighting of accented characters.

Wed Mar  1 16:02:49 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htfuzzy/htfuzzy.cc (main): Correctly test return value on Open()

        * htlib/DB2_db.cc (Error): Simply fprint the error message on
        stderr. This is not a method since the db.h interface expects a C
        function.
        (db_init): Don't set db_errfile, instead set errcall to point to
        the new Error function.

	* htsearch/Display.h, htsearch/Display.cc: Loop through
	collections as we are assembling results.

	the final score. This requires an increase in magnitude in weight
	to correspond to a factor of increase in score.

	* htsearch/DocMatch.h, htsearch/DocMatch.cc: Keep track of the
	collection we're in.

	* htsearch/ResultMatch.h: Ditto.

	* htsearch/htsearch.h, htsearch/htsearch.cc: Wrap results in
	collections.

	* htsearch/parser.h, htsearch/parser.cc: Set the collection for
	the results--we use this to get to the appropriate word DB.
	(score): Divide word weights by word frequency to calibrate for

	* htlib/DB2_db.cc: Remove include of malloc.h, as it causes problems

Thu Feb 24 13:11:15 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htnet/HtFile.cc (Request): Don't append more than _max_document_size
	bytes to _contents string, set _content_length to size returned by
	stat().
	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc (HTTPRequest): Extra tests in case Content-Length
	not given for non-chunked input, and not to close persistent
	connection when chunked input exceeds _max_document_size.
	(ReadChunkedBody): Don't append more than _max_document_size bytes
	to _contents string.

	* htlib/URL.cc (ServerAlias): Fix server_aliases processing to prevent

	* htlib/HtDateTime.h, htlib/HtDateTime.cc: change Httimegm() method

	* htlib/Configuration.cc(Read): Fixed to allow final line without

	  and handle them properly to fix the Override bug without performance
	  loss.

	* test/conf/httpd.conf.in: comment out loading of mod_rewrite
	  since not everyone has it.

Thu Feb 10 00:26:02 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* .version: Bump for 3.2.0b2.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Add category fields for each

	<Wilhelm.Schnell at mn.man.de> to resolve PR#754.

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc (HTTPRequest): Add CloseConnection() when the

	* htdig/Server.cc (robotstxt): apply more rigorous parsing of
	multiple user-agent fields, and use only the first one.

	properly compile case_sensitive expressions.

	* test/t_wordskip: copy $srcdir/skiptest_db.txt to allow running

	  regarding document size assignment (raised by Valdas Andrulis)

Sun Feb 06 19:11:05 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* configure.in: Fix inconsistencies between default values 
	  shown by ./configure and actual defaults.

	* htdoc/install.html: change example version 3.1 to 3.2
	  Commented out warning about libguile.
	  Replace CONFIG variables by configure.in options.
	  Specify default value for each of them.
	  Replace (and move) make depend by automake (distributed
	  Makefiles do not include dependency generation)
	  Added section for running tests.
	  Added section on shared libraries.

	* configure.in: use AM_CONDITIONAL for --enable-tests

	* Makefile.am: use automake conditionals for subdir so
	  that make dist knows what to distribution --enable-tests
	  specified or not.

	* db/Makefile.in: allow make dist to work outside the source
	  tree.

Sat Feb 05 18:31:04 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test/word.cc (SkipTestEntries): The fix of 
	  WordList::SkipUselessSequentialWalking actually saves us
	  a few hops when walking lists of words.

Fri Feb 04 17:28:32 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordKey.cc,WordReference.cc,WordRecord.cc (Print): use
	  cerr instead of cout for immediate printing under debugger.

Thu Feb  3 16:06:45 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Document.cc (RetrieveLocal): fix bug that prevented local
	filesystem digging, because max_doc_size was initialized to 0.
	Now sets it to max_doc_size for current url.

Thu Feb  3 12:36:56 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* installdir/Makefile.{am,in}: install mime.types as mime.types,
	not as htdig.conf.

	* htfuzzy/EndingsDB.cc (createDB): fix code to use MV macro in
	system() command, not hard-coded "MV" string literal, and use
	get() on config objects to avoid passing String objects to form().

Wed Feb  2 19:44:33 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtDateTime.cc (SetRFC1123): Strip off weekday, if present
	and use LOOSE format.
	(SetRFC850): Ditto.

	* configure.in, configure: Add configure check for "mv."

	* htfuzzy/Makefile.am: Use it.

	* */Makefile.in: Regenerate using automake.

	* htfuzzy/EndingsDB.cc (createDB): Use the detected mv, or
	whatever is in the path to move the endings DB when they're
	finished.

Wed Feb  2 15:49:14 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Document.cc (RetrieveLocal), htdig/Retriever.cc (GetLocal):
	Fix compilation errors.  Oops!

Wed Feb  2 13:53:27 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (IsValidURL): fix problem with valid_extensions
	matching failure when URL parameters follow extension.

Wed Feb  2 13:29:48 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/QuotedStringList.cc (Create): fix PR#743, where quoted string
	lists didn't allow embedded quotes of opposite sort in strings
	(e.g. "'" or '"'), and fix to avoid overrunning end of string
	if it ends with backslash.

Wed Feb  2 13:23:16 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/HTML.cc (ctor, parse, do_tag), htcommon/defaults.cc:
	Add max_keywords attribute to limit meta keyword spamming.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:

Wed Feb  2 12:57:40 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Document.cc (RetrieveLocal), htdig/Document.h,
	htdig/Retriever.cc (Initial, parse_url, GetLocal, GetLocalUser,

	enhancements to local_urls, local_default_urls & local_default_doc.
	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Document these.

Wed Feb 02 10:14:57 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordKeyInfo.h,WordKey.{cc,h}: fix overflow bug when 32
	  bits. For that purpose implement Outbound/Overflow/Underflow
	  methods in WordKey, MaxValue in WordKey/WordKeyInfo.
	  (WordKey::SetToFollowing) was FUBAR : overflow of field1 tested
	  with number of bits in next field, do not handle overflow,
	  Re-implemented.
	  (WordKey::Set) Change atoi to strtoul.
	  (WordList::SkipUselessSequentialWalking) was much to fucked up
	  to explain. Re-implement
	  (WordKey::Diff) Added as a support function of
	  SkipUselessSequentialWalking.
	  implement consistent verbosity.

	* htword/WordList.cc (operator >>): explicit error message when
	  insert failed, with line number.

Wed Feb  2 00:11:03 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdoc/RELEASE.html: Finish up with notes on all significant 
	new attributes.

	* contrib/README: Update to mention new scripts.

	* installdir/mime.types: Add default Apache mime.types file for
	systems that do not already have one.

	* installdir/Makefile.am: Make sure it is installed by default.

	* installdir/Makefile.in: Regenerate using automake.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Add documentation for mime_types
	attribute, remove currently unused image_alt_factor, and add
	documentation for external_protocols.

	* htdoc/attrs.html, htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:
	Regenerate using cf_generate.pl.

Tue Feb  1 10:24:19 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/parser.cc (score): fix up score calculations for
	correctness and efficiency.

Mon Jan 31 16:29:20 2000  Marcel Bosc  <bosc at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordBitCompress.cc: fixed endian bug in compression

Sat Jan 29 21:14:03 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/parser.cc (score): Change config.Value (which returns
	int) to config.Double to preserve accuracy of attributes.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Updated documentation for attributes now
	allowing regex, search_algorithms (for new fuzzy) and added
	documentation for the overlooked remove_unretrieved_urls.
	
	* htdoc/*.html: Updated copyright notice for 2000, changed footer
	to use CVS's magic Date keyword. Regenerated documentation from
	defaults changes.

Sat Jan 29 16:32:08 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* contrib/htdig-3.1.4.spec, contrib/htdig-3.1.4-conf.patch: Remove
	these since they don't apply to the 3.2.x releases.

	* htfuzzy/Synonym.cc (openIndex): Change database format from
	DB_BTREE to DB_HASH--no reason for the synonym database to be a
	btree. This was probably overlooked when I switched the rest of
	the fuzzy databases over to DB_HASH.

Sat Jan 29 05:34:26 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordKey.h (UnpackNumber): Very nasty bug. Optimization
	  dated Dec 29 broke endianess on Solaris. Restore previous version.

Fri Jan 28 18:17:08 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/Configuration.h (struct ConfigDefaults): Add version and
	category fields for more accurate documentation.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Add blank category fields and start
	filling in version field. Killed modification_time_is_now_attribute.

	* htdig/Document.cc (Document): Kill attribute
	modification_time_is_now since it can cause more harm than good. 
	
	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc (ParseHeader): Ditto.	

	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl: Added support for new version and category
	fields. Currently category does nothing, but it could split the
	documentation into categories.

Sat Jan 29 01:37:45 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* .version: remove the trailing -dev

Thu Jan 27 12:22:57 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordList.cc: cdebug replaced by cerr. replace lverbose
	  by verbose > 2. Remove shutup. 
	  (WordList): monitor = 0
	  (Open): create monitor only if wordlist_monitor = true
	  (Close): delete monitor if set, delete compressor if set

	* htword/WordDBCompress.cc,WordList.cc: only activate monitoring code
	  if monitor is set. No interaction with the monitor is therefore possible
	  if wordlist_monitor is false.

	* htword/WordMonitor.cc: remove useless test of wordlist_monitor (done by
	  WordList now).

	* htword/WordDBCompress.cc (TestCompress): remove redundant debuglevel argument.

	* htword/WordDBCompress.cc (WordDBCompress): init cmprInfo to 0

	* db/include/db_cxx.h: Add get_mp_cmpr_info method

	* htword/WordDBCompress.cc (WordDBCompress): set default debug level to 0

	* htword/WordDB.h: CmprInfo returns current CmprInfo and non static,
	  overload to set CmprInfo if argument given.

	* htword/WordDBCompress.h: new CmprInfo() method returns DB_CMPR_INFO object
	  for Berkeley DB database.

	* htword/WordList.h: add compressor member, kill cmprInfo member.

	* htword/WordList.cc: 

Wed Jan 26 20:05:33 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordList.cc,htword/WordList.h: get rid of obsolete WordBenchmarking

Wed Jan 26 9:14:32 2000 CEST Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

        * htcommon/defaults.cc: added "max_connection_requests".

        * htdig/Retriever.cc: now manages the attribute above.

Tue Jan 25 12:59:01 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (setVariables): fixed 
	  Display.cc:505: warning: multiline `//' comment

Tue Jan 25 8:37:15 2000 CEST Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htdig/Document.h: Added the "HtHTTP *GetHTTPHandler()" method, in
	  order to be able to control an HTTP object outside the Document class.
	  This is useful for the Server class, after the request for robots.txt.
	  We can control the response of a server and check if it supports
	  persistent connections.

	* htdig/Server.cc: inside the constructor, persistent_connections var is
	  initialized to the configuration parameter value, instead of <true>.
	  Besides, after the request of the robots.txt, it controls and set
	  the attribute for persistent connections, depending on whether the
	  server supports them or not.
   
	* htdig/Retriever.cc: modified the Start() method. Now the loop manage
	  HTTP persistent connections "on a server" basis. Indeed, it's a
	  Server object that decides if persisent connections are allowed on
	  that server or not (depending on configuration or capabilities of
	  the remote http server).

Mon Jan 24 12:57:45 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc(setVariables): Added double quotes around
	default selection value in build_select_lists handling.

Mon Jan 24 12:37:22 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc(setVariables), htcommon/defaults.cc: Added
	build_select_lists attribute, to generate selector menus in forms.
	Added relevant explanations and links to selectors documentation.
	* htdoc/hts_selectors.html: Added this page to explain this new
	feature, plus other details on select lists in general.
	* htdoc/hts_templates.html: Added relevant links to related attributes
	and selectors documentation.
	* htdoc/attrs.html, cf_by{name,prog}.html: reran cf_generate.pl

Fri Jan 21 18:57:58 EET 2000  Vadim Chekan  <vadim at etc.lviv.ua>

	* htcommon/HtConfiguration.cc: added HtConfiguration::ParseString(char*)
	method to allow lexer handle "include: ${var}/file.inc" construction

	* htcommon/conf_lexer.lxx: fixed handling "include: ${var}file.inc" 
	bug.

Fri Jan 21 17:04:28 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordList.cc (WalkFinish,WalkInit,WalkNextStep): fix typos in error messages
	  and misleading comment.

	* htword/WordList.h,WordList.cc: move part of WalkInit in WalkRewind so that
	  we have a function to go back to the beginning of possible matches.

Wed Jan 19 21:49:57 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/HTML.cc (do_tag): Only add words for META descriptions,
	keywords, and IMG ALT attributes if doindex is set.

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.h: Added Reference_obsolete for documents
	that should be removed (but haven't).

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (parse_url): Flag documents that have been
	modified as Reference_obsolete and update the database. Flag all
	documents with various errors as something other than
	Reference_normal, as appropriate--these probably should be pruned.

	* htdig/Retriever.h: Get rid of GetRef() method--it's only used once!
	
	* htsearch/Display.cc (display): Don't show DocumentRefs with
	states other than Reference_normal--these documents have various
	errors.

	* htmerge/docs.cc: If a document has a state of Reference_obsolete, ignore it.

	* htcommon/HtWordList.h, htcommon/HtWordList.cc (Skip): Change
	MarkGone() to Skip() to emphasize that this document should be ignored.

Wed Jan 19 14:11:51 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordList.cc (SkipUselessSequentialWalking): return OK if skipping, 
	  NOTOK if not skipping.

	* htword/WordReference.h: remove useless Clear in WordReference(key, record) 
	  constructor.

	* htword/WordList.h,WordList.cc: Split Walk in three separate functions
	  WalkInit, WalkNext and WalkFinish. Much clearer. Fill the status field
	  of WordSearchDescription to have more information about the error condition.
	  Add found field to WordSearchDescription for WalkNext result. Add cursor_get_flags
	  and searchKeyIsSamePrefix fields to WordSearchDescription as internal state
	  information.

	* htword/WordList.h,WordList.cc: WalkInit to create and prepare cursor,
	  WalkNext to move to next match
	  WalkNextStep to move to next index entry, be it a match or not
	  WalkFinish to release cursor.

	* htword/WordList.h: WordSearchDescription::ModifyKey add to jump
	  while walking.

	* htword/WordList.cc (WalkNext) : it is now legal to step without
	  collection or callback because search contains the last match (found
	  field) and it s therefore not useless.
	
Mon Jan 17 12:15:45 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* contrib/htdig-3.2.0.spec: added sample RPM spec file for 3.2

Sat Jan 15 11:53:35 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htdb/htstat.cc,htdb/htdump.cc: remove useless -S option since
	  the page size is found in the header of the file.

	* htdb/htstat.cc,htdump.cc,htload.cc: only call WordContext::Initialize
	  if -W flag specified.

Fri Jan 14 18:39:12 2000  Marcel Bosc   <bosc at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordBitCompress.cc: speedup, VlengthCoder::code()
	finds appropriate coding interval much faster

Fri Jan 14 11:30:41 2000  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Retriver.cc(IsValidURL): Fix problem with valid_extensions,
	which got lost in the shuffle yesterday.

Fri Jan 14 15:56:49 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordType.cc,WordRecord.cc,WordKeyInfo.cc (Initialize): change
	  inverted test on instance (== instead of !=).

	* htword/WordRecord.cc (WordRecordInfo): change inverted test on compare

Fri Jan 14 14:24:39 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

        * htdig/htdig.cc,htmerge/htmerge.cc,htsearch/htsearch.cc: Use Initialize(defaults)
	  to load configuration file if provided.
	
	* htword/WordDBCompress.cc (Compress): initialize monitor to null in
	  constructor and check if null before usage. Core dumped in htdb/htload.

	* htword/WordContext.h (class WordContext): Add 
	  Initialize(const ConfigDefaults* config_defaults = 0)
	  that probe configuration files. Usefull when htword is used as a standalone library.

Thu Jan 13 19:52:27 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Retriver.cc: Fix problem with valid_extensions when an
	"extension" would include part of a directory path or server
	name, as contributed by Warren Jones.

Thu Jan 13 19:22:25 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htnet/Makefile.am, htnet/Makefile.in: Add HtFile to the build process.

Thu Jan 13 18:58:03 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htnet/HtFile.h, htnet/HtFile.cc: New Transport classes
	contributed by Alexis Mikhailov to allow file:// access.

	* htdig/Document.h, htdig/Document.cc: Add logic to call HtFile
	objects for URLs.

	* htcommon/URL.cc: Don't remove a trailing index.html (removeIndex)
	if the URL is a file://URL.

Thu Jan 13 18:49:41 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* contrib/conv_doc.pl, contrib/parse_doc.pl: Replace "break" by
	"last" for correct Perl syntax and additional cleanups and
	simplifications as contributed by Warren Jones.

Thu Jan 13 18:42:29 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htword/WordType.h, htword/WordType.cc: Implementation of new
	methods IsDigit() and IsCntrl() as contributed by Marc Pohl
	<marc.pohl at wdr.de>. Fixes some problems with 8-bit characters.

Thu Jan 13 17:17:47 2000  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* ChangeLog.0, configure, configure.in, htfuzzy/Endings.cc,

	htlib/QuotedStringList.cc, htlib/regex.c, htcommon/defaults.cc,
	htdig/ExternalParser.cc, htdig/Retriever.h, htsearch/Display.cc,
	include/htconfig.h.in installdir/htdig.conf: Merge in changes from
	3.1.x releases.

	* htdoc/: Merge in documentation changes from 3.1.x releases.

Thu Jan 13 20:12:42 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordList.cc (Walk): close the cursor before returning. If
	  not doing that the cursor might be closed after the database is
	  closed, leading to double free of the cursor. Bad bug.

Thu Jan 13 13:23:17 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordContext.h (class WordContext): simplifies a lot. WordContext is
	  no longer a repository for pointers of class instances. Only a place to call
	  Initialize for classes that have a single instance.

	* htlib/HtWordType.cc: added to include definition of functions shortcuts for
	  WordType.

	* htword/WordRecord.h,WordType.h,WordKeyInfo.h: implement homogeneous scheme to
	  handle unique instance of the class.
	  - constructor takes const Configuration& argument and init object with config
	    values
	  - static member instance
	  - static method Initialize the static member instance
	  - static method Instance returns the pointer in instance data member
	
        * htword/WordRecord.cc: add constructor for WordRecordInfo, and Instance static
	  function. Add WORD_RECORD_INVALID to depict uninitialize WordRecordInfo object.

	* htword/WordKeyInfo.h: rename SetKeyDescriptionFromFile and SetKeyDescriptionFromString
	  to InitializeFromFile and InitializeFromString and implement them by calling Initialize.
	  rename SetKeyDescriptionRandom to InitializeRandom
	  rename Initialize(String& line) to GetNFields(String& line)
	  rename Initialize(int nfields) to Alloc(int nfields)

	* htdig/htdig.cc,htmerge/htmerge.cc,htsearch/htsearch.cc,test/word.cc: replace 
	  WordList::Initialize with WordContext::Initialize and run immediately after
	  config is read. Otherwise WordType fails to work and configuration value
	  extraction will fail.

	* htmerge/htmerge.cc: move initialization 

	* test/conf/htdig.conf2.in: reorder so that it looks as much as possible as conf.in
	
Thu Jan 13 12:33:46 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htdb/htstat.cc,htdump.cc,htload.cc: set proper progname

Wed Jan 12 19:38:33 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htlib/HtDateTime.h (class HtDateTime): killed void SetDateTime(const int t)
	  because they cause problems when time_t is an int and were useless anyway.

Wed Jan 12 13:31:45 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordBitCompress.h: remove inline qualifier on check_tag1: its not inline
	
	* htword/WordKey.h: #define WORD_KEY_UNKNOWN_POSITION to -1. Remove default
	  argument to SetToFollowing so that its more explicit when used with
	  WORD_KEY_UNKNOWN_POSITION.

	* htword/WordKey.cc: change name of variable info0 to info

	* htword/WordList.cc: use WordKey::Info instead of WordKeyInfo::Get as done
	  in WordKey.cc for consistency.

	* htword/WordList.{cc,h},htword/WordDB.h: rename WordCursor to WordDBCursor
	  for consistency.

	* htword/WordList.h: Kill the WordSearchDescription::Setup useless function

	* htword/WordList.h: WordSearchDescription constructor now have a straightforward
	  semantics.

	* htword/WordList.h: Rename Search into Collect since it already existed, just
	  with a different prototype.

Wed Jan 12 12:36:46 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordList.h (class WordSearchDescription): add cursor member

	* htword/WordList.h: move operator << and operator >> to end of
	  functions declarations instead of data members.

	* htword/WordList.h: added more comments on functions behaviour.

	* htword/WordList.h: added #if SWIG for Perl interface

Mon Jan 10 17:55:05 2000  Marcel Bosc  <bosc at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordDBPage: enhanced compression debugging output

Mon Jan 10 09:07:19 2000  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* WordContext.h,WordKey.h,WordList.h: Added #if SWIG for perl 
	  interfaces. Remove InSortOrder, useless now that everything
	  is manipulated in sort order as far as the interface is concerned.

	* WordKey.cc,WordList.cc: remove InSortOrder

	* WordKey.h,WordRecord.h,WordReference.h: commented out Set/Get for
	  ascii Set/Get for SWIG.

	  (htdump & al).

	* db/dist/Makefile.in (prefix): prepend $(DESTDIR) to prefix
	  to support make DESTDIR=/staging install for binary distribution
	  packages generation.

	* configure.in: use AC_FUNC_ALLOCA to check for alloca. Used

	  prevent #line generation because it confuses the dependencies
	  generator of GCC if configure run out of source tree.

	* configure.in: remove --with-key option. Not needed since

Mon Dec 20 17:59:15 1999  Marcel Bosc  <bosc at ceic.com>

	* WordKey: Made the key structure dynamic: Changing the
	key structure used to imply recompiling the htword library.
	This should not change anything in htdig.

	* WordKey: numerical key fields are stored in an array of unsigned
	ints instead of compile-time defined pools.

	* WordKey.h: WordKey now needs copy opreators. Setbits are stored
	in sort order (used to be in encoding order)

	* htword: word_key_info is now a pointer, had to change all references
	
	* word.cc: Rewrote wordkey test for new dynamically
	set key structure. The test randomly creates key structures
	and tests them.

	* test: adapted test files (simplifies things a lot)
	
1999-12-21  Toivo Pedaste  <toivo at ucs.uwa.edu.au>

	* htlib/Dictionary.cc: Fix memory leak when destroying dictionary

Mon Dec 20 21:59:03 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htdb/{Makefile.am,err.c,getlong.c}: Fix mistake: err.c and
	  getlong.c contain C functions (declared in clib_ext) and 
	  must be C compiled otherwise the prototype won't fit. Checking
	  db Makefiles, getlong.c and err.c are added to the list of objects
	  for each utility program. This guaranties that they won't conflict
	  with objects included in libdb.a. 

Sun Dec 19 20:04:42 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htdb/{Makefile.am, err.cc}: add err.cc for portability

	input methods, readLine() and >> operator.

Wed Dec 15 13:59:34 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc: remove include of sys/stat.h, which is no
	longer needed after hack removed from Need2Get(), and could pose
	a problem on systems that need sys/types.h included first.

Wed Dec 15 17:00:04 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordDB.h: add inline keyword for portability

	* htword/WordDB.h: add CmprInfo method to get object describing

	* BerkelyDB: Compression code: added possibility to use 
	user-defined compression routines (the goal is to enable 
	the mifluz-specific DB page compression that obtains 
	higher compression ratios than generic zlib compression)
	this envolves the following changes in BerkeleyDB:
	* BerkelyDB/CompressionEnvironment: Adding a structure db_cmpr_info
	in db_env that permits db user to specify the external compression
	routines and other information related to compression

	to DB_MPOOLFILE that stores information that compression needs
	 (the _weacmpr DB and the db_cmpr_info)
	* BerkelyDB/Compression: Needed to modify the compression
	system (that is implemented in the BerkelyDB  memory pool) to permit
	higher compression ratios and to use the compression environment

Thu Dec  2 16:47:30 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	the base of the server.

	* htdig/Server.h: Add IsDead() methods to query the status of the
	server, as well as an IsDisallowed() method to query whether a URL
	is forbidden by the robots.txt rules. Change _disallow to HtRegex.

	* htdig/Server.cc(ctor): Only retrieve the robots.txt file if this
	is an http or https server.
	(robotstxt): Use the proper HtRegex method for setting the pattern.
	(push): Remove logic checking the _disallow patterns. This is now
	done by the Retriever object.

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Add new attribute "local_urls_only" which
	defaults to false, which dictates whether retrieval should revert
	to another method if RetrieveLocal() fails.
	
	* htdig/Retriever.cc(parse_url): Check to see if the server is
	dead before calling the Retrieve() method. Notify the server
	object if a connection fails. Also respects the new
	local_urls_only attribute as described above.

	  outside the source directory.
	
	* htword/WordList: Add Ref and Unref to update statistics.
	  Fix walking to start from the end of statistics. All statistics
	  words start with \001, therefore at the beginning of the file and
	  all clustered together.

	* htword/WordStat: derived from WordReference to implement
	  uniq word statistics.

	* test/word.cc: test statistics updating.

	* htword/WordKey.cc: fix bugous compare (returned length diff
	  if key of different length).

Mon Oct 04 18:43:56 1999  Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* test/testnet.cc: added the option for HEAD before GET control

Mon Oct 04 17:33:24 1999  Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htnet/Transport.h .cc: added the FlushConnection() method

	* htnet/HtHTTP.h .cc: now the Request() method can make a HEAD
	  request precede a GET request. This is made by default, and
	  can be changed by using the methods Enable/DisableHeadBeforeGet().
	  A configuration option can be raised to manage it.

Mon Oct 04 12:43:41 1999  Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htlib/io.h .cc: added a flush() method.

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc: manage the chunk correctly, by calling the  flush()
	  method after reading it.

Mon Oct 04 12:02:24 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htlib/htString.h: move null outside inline operator [] functions.

Fri Oct 01 14:55:56 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htword/WordRecord: mutable, can also contain uniq word statistics.

	* htword/WordReference: remove all dependencies related to the actual
	  structure of the key.
	
	* htcommon/HtWordReference: derived from WordReference, explicit
	  accessors.
	
	* htcommon/HtWordList: derived from WordList, only handles the
	  word cache (Flush, MarkGone).
	
	* htdig/HTML.cc (do_tag): add wordindex to have location set in
	  tags

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.cc (AddDescription): add Location calculation

	* htword/WordList.cc: add dberror to map Berkeley DB error codes

	* htsearch/Display.cc (display): initialize good_sort to get rid
	  of strange warning.

Fri Oct 01 09:02:11 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* Makefile.config: duplicate library lines to resolve 
	  interdependencies.

Thu Sep 30 17:56:55 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htmerge/words.cc (delete_word): Upgrade to use WordCursor.

	* htword/WordList: Walk now uses a local WordCursor. Many concurent
	  Walk can happen at the same time.

	* htword/WordList: Walk callback now take the current WordCursor.
	  Added a Delete method that takes the WordCursor. Allows to delete
	  the current record while walking.
	
	* db/include/db_cxx.h (DB_ENV): add int return type to operator = 

	* db/dist/configure.in (CXXFLAGS): disable adding obsolete
	  g++ option.

	* configure.in: enable C++ support when configuring Berkeley DB

	* htword: create. move Word* from htcommon. move HtWordType
	  from htlib and rename WordType.

	* htword/WordList: use db_cxx interface instead of Database.
	  Less interface overhead. Get access to full capabilities of
	  Berkeley DB. Much more error checking done.
	  Create WordCursor private class to use String instead of Dbt.

Wed Sep 29 20:03:31 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* htlib/lib.h: AIX xlC does is confused by overloaded mystrcasestr
	  that only differ in constness. Only keep const form and use cast
	  where approriate. *sigh*
	
	* htlib/htString.h: accomodate new form of Object::compare and
	  Copy. Explicitly convert compare arg to String&, prevent hiding
	  and therefore missing the underlying compare function.
	
	* htlib/HtVector.cc (Copy): make it const

	* htlib/HtHeap.cc: accomodate new form of Object::compare
	
	* htcommon/List.h,cc: Add ListCursor to allow many pointers that
	  walk the list to exist in the same program.

	* htlib/Object.h (class Object): kill unused Serialize + Deserialize.
	  Change unused Copy to const and bark on stderr if called because it
	  is clearly not was is wanted. If Copy is called and the derived class
	  does not implement Copy we are in trouble. Alternatives are to make
	  it pure virtual but it will break things all over the code or to abort
	  but this will be considered to violent. Change compare to take a
	  const reference and be a const.

Wed Sep 29 16:51:58 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* acinclude.m4,configure.in,Makefile.config: remove -Wall from
	  Makefile.conf, add the AC_COMPILE_WARNINGS macro in acinclude.m4
	  and use it in configure.in.

	* htdoc/default_check.pl: remove, unused

Wed Sep 29 13:07:58 1999  Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htnet/Transport: fixed some bugs on construction and destruction
        
        * htnet/HtHTTP: the most important add is the decoding of chunked
          encoded responses, as reported on RFC2616 (HTTP/1.1). It needs
          to be developed, because it timeouts at the end of the request.
          Added a function pointer in order to dynamically handle the function
          that reads the body of a response (for now, normal and chunked, but
          other encoding ways exist, so ...). Fixed some bugs on construction
          and added some features like Server and Transfer-encoding headers.

Wed Sep 29 13:54:59 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* fix all inline method declarations so that they are always declared
	  inline in the class declaration if an inline definition follows.

	* acinclude.m4: also search apache in /usr/local/apache/bin by default.

	* fix various warnings of gcc-2.95, now compiles ok without warnings
	  and with -Wall.

	* htlib/htString.h: removed commented out inline get

	* test/testnet.cc: add includes for optarg

Tue Sep 28 18:56:36 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* Makefile.config (HTLIBS): libhtnet at the beginning of the list. It
	  matters on Solaris-2.6 for instance.

	* test/testnet.cc: change times to timesvar to avoid conflict with
	  function (was warning only on Solaris-2.6).
	
	* htdig,htsearch,htmerge,test/word are purify clean when running
	  make check.

Tue Sep 28 18:23:49 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htmerge/words.cc (mergeWords): use WordList::Walk to avoid loading ALL 
	  the words into memory.

	* htlib/DB2_db.cc (Open): we don't want duplicates. Big mistake. If DUP is
	  on, every put for update will insert a new entry.

	* htcommon/WordList.cc (Delete): separate Delete (straight Delete and WalkDelete) 
	  to avoid accessing dbf from outside WordList.

	* htcommon/WordList.cc (Walk): now promoted to public. 
	
Tue Sep 28 16:34:56 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test/word.cc (dolist): Add regression tests for Delete.

	* htcommon/WordList.cc (Delete): Reimplement from scratch. Use Walk
	  to find records to delete. This allows to say delete all occurence
	  of this word, delete all words in this document (slow), delete
	  all occurences of this word in this document etc.

	* htcommon/WordList.cc (Walk): extend so that it handles walk for
	  partially specified keys, remains fully backward compatible. It allows
	  to extract all the words in a specific document (slow) or all occurences
	  of a word in a specific document etc.

Tue Sep 28 12:56:12 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.cc (Open): report errors on stderr

	* htmerge/docs.cc (convertDocs): rely on error reporting from DocumentDB
	  instead of implementing a custom one.

Tue Sep 28 11:36:28 1999  Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htnet/Transport.h: added the status code and the reason phrase

	* htnet/HtHTTP.cc .h: removed the attributes above.
	  Read the body of a response if the code is 2xx. Issues the
	  GetLocation() method.

Tue Sep 28 10:32:47 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test/htdocs/set3: create and populate with cgi scripts have
	  bad behaviour (time out and, slow connection).

Tue Sep 28 10:20:23 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test/htdocs: move html files in set1/set2 subdirectories to allows
	  tests that use different set of files. Change htdig.conf accordingly.

Tue Sep 28 09:31:12 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test/Makefile.am: comment test options, add LONG_TEST='y' for lengthy
	  tests, by default run quick tests.

	* installdir/bad_words: removed it an of : since the minimum word
	  length is by default 3, these words are ignored anyway.

Mon Sep 27 20:37:38 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htlib/HtWordType.h,cc: concentrate knowledge about word definition in this
	  class. Rename the class WordType (think WordReference etc...). Change
	  Initialize to use an external default object. A WordType object may be
	  allocated on its own. Drag functionalities from BadWordFile, Replace and
	  IsValid of WordList, and concentrate them in the WordType::Normalize 
	  function.

	* htcommon/WordList: use the new WordList semantic. WordType is now a member
	  of WordList, opening the possibility to have many WordList object with different
	  configurations within the same program since the constructor takes 
	
	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (setupWords): Use HtNormalize to find out if word should
	  be ignored in query. Formerly using IsValid.

	* htlib/String.cc (operator []): fix big mistake, operator [] was indeed last() !

	* htlib/String.cc(uppercase, lowercase): return the number of converted chars.

	* htlib/String.cc(remove): return the number of chars removed.

Mon Sep 27 17:43:23 1999  Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* Created testnet.cc under test dir for trying the htnet library
          It's a simple program that retrieves an URL.

        * htnet/HtHTTP.cc, .h: added a 'int (*) (char *)' function pointer.
          This attribute is static and it is used under the isParsable method
          in order to determine if a document is parsable. It must be set
          outside this class by using the SetParsingController static method.
          The classic use is to set it to 'ExternalParser::canParse' .

Mon Sep 27 10:52:51 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htmerge/db.cc (mergeDB): delete words instead of words->Destroy()
	  because the words object itself was not freed.

	* Created 'htnet' library

Mon Sep 27 12:39:24 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test/word.cc (dolist): don't deal with upper case at present and prevent warning.

Mon Sep 27 10:38:37 1999  Gabriele Bartolini  <g.bartol at comune.prato.it>

	* htlib/String.cc: removed compiler warnings

	* htdig/HtHTTP.h: corrected cvs Id property

	* htlib/String.cc (String): make sure *all* constructors set the Data
	  member to 0.

	* htsearch/parser.cc (score): add missing dm->id = wr->DocID();
	  strange it did not make search fail horribly. 

Mon Sep 27 09:46:34 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test/conf/htdig.conf.in (common_dir): add common_dir so that
	  templates are found in compile directory.

	  needed.

Fri Sep 24 16:35:47 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.ccf (Open): change mode to 666 instead of 664, 
	  it's the bizness of umask to remove permission bits.

	* htlib/URL.cc (removeIndex): Memory leak. do not use l.Release
	  since standard Destroy called by destructor is ok.

	* htdig/htdig.cc (main): Memory leak. Use l.Destroy instead of 
	  l.Release.

	* htlib/StringList.cc (Join): Memory leak (new String str + 
	  return *str). Also change to const fct.

	* htlib/List.cc (Nth): add const version to help StringList::Join save
	  memory.

	* htdig/HTML.cc (parse): delete [] text (was missing [])

	* htlib/HtVector.cc: Most of the boundary tests with element_count
	  (but not all of them) were wrong (> instead of >= for instance).
	
	* htlib/HtVector.cc (Previous): limit test cut and pasted from Next
	  and obviously completely wrong. Fix.

	* htlib/HtVector.cc (Remove): use RemoveFrom, avoid code duplication.

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.cc (Clear): set all numerical fields to 0,
	  and truncate strings to 0. Some were missing.

	* htlib/Connection.cc (Connection): free(server_name) because allocated
	  by strdup not new.

Fri Sep 24 14:30:21 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* */.cvsignore: update to include .pure, *.la, *.lo, .purify
	
	* htlib/String.cc (String): add Data = 0

	* htlib/htString.h (class String): add Data = 0

	* htlib/String.cc (String): init set to MinimumAllocationSize at least
	  prevents leaking if init = 0.

	* htlib/String.cc (nocase_compare): use get() instead of direct
	  pointer to Data so that the trailing null will be added.

	* htlib/Dictionary.cc (DictionaryEntry): free(key) instead of
	  delete [] key because obtained with strdup.

	* htlib/DB2_db.cc (Close): free(dbenv) because db_appexit does not
	  free this although it free everything else.

Thu Sep 23 18:18:40 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* configure.in: add PERL detection & use in Makefile.am

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.h: Add some const in inline functions arguments.

	* htcommon/Makefile.am: add WordKey + WordKey.h generation

	* htcommon/word_builder.pl, word.desc, WordKey.h.tmpl: generate WordKey.h from WordKey.h.tmpl and
	  word.desc

	* htcommon/WordList.cc: In general remove code that belongs to WordReference rather
	  than WordList and cleanup const + String.
	  (WordList) the constructor takes a Configuration object in argument. 
	  (Word -> Replace): Word method replaced by Replace method because more explicit. Now
	  taks a WordReference in argument instead of the list of fields values.
	  (valid_word deleted, IsValid only): Add some const in functions arguments.
	  (BadWordFile): change char* args to const String&
	  (Open + Read -> Open): Open and Read merge into Open with mode argument. change char* args

	* htdig/htdig.cc: change all config[""] manipulations from char* to String
	  
	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl: compute attrs.html, cf_byprog.html and cf_byname.html from

	  cf_byprog_head.html cf_byprog_tail.html
	  Add rules in Makefile.am

	* htfuzzy: In every programs I changed the constructor to take a
	  Configuration agrument.  The openIndex and writeDB had this
	  argument sometime used it, sometimes used the global
	  config. Having it in the contructor is cleaner and safer, there
	  is no more reference to the global config. I also changed some
	  char* to String and const. Most of the program look the same, I
	  won't go into details here :-}

	* htlib/Configuration.cc: changed separators from String* to String. Simpler.
	  (~Configuration): removed because not needed.
	  (Add): change to String, remove new String + delete for local var.

	  Remove all other Get_Next interfaces.

	* htlib/Database.h: 
	  Compatibility functions for Get_Next
	  Put, Get, Exists, Delete take String args and are inline
	  Add SetPrefix and SetCompare

	* htlib/Dictionary.cc:
	  Add copy constructor.
	  Add DictionaryCursor that holds the traversal context.
	  Use DictionaryCursor object for traversal without explicit
	  cursor specified.
	  Add constness where meaningfull.

	* htlib/HtPack.cc: 
	  (htPack) format is const, change strtol call
	  to use temporary variable to cope with constness.

	  anywhere and kind of hidden argument nobody wants.

	* htlib/HtRegex.cc: set, match, HtRegex have const args.

	* htlib/HtWordCodec.cc: (code) orig is const

	  Add as_double conversion.
	
	* htlib/StringList.cc: inline functions argument variations and
	  add constness.

	* htlib/StringMatch.cc: add constness to function args.

	* htlib/URL.cc: add constness to function args.
	  (URL): fct arg was used as temp. Change, clearer.

	  Two forms for mystrcasestsr: const and not const.

	* htlib/strcasecmp.cc: add constness to function args.

	* htlib/timegm.c: add declaration for __mktime_internal

Thu Sep 23 14:29:29 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htcommon/WordKey.h.tmpl, WordKey.cc: new, describe the key of the word
	  database.

	* htcommon/word.desc: new, abstract description of the key structure of the word
	  database.

	* htcommon/word_builder.pl: new, generate WordKey.h from WordKey.h.tmpl
	
	* htcommon/WordReference.cc: move key manipulation to WordKey.cc
	  Add Unpack/Pack functions. Add accessors for fields and move fields to private.
	  Add constness where possible.

Mon Sep 20 14:50:47 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* Everywhere config["string"] is used, check that it's *not* converted to 
	  char* for later use. Keep String object so that there is no chance to
	  use a char* that has been deallocated. Using a String as return for config["string"]
	  is also *much* safer for the great number of calls that did not check for a possible
	  0 pointer return.
	
	* htfuzzy/*.{cc,h}: const Configuration& config member. Constructor sets it.
	  Remove config argument from openIndex & writeDB. The idea (as it was initialy,
	  I guess) is to be able to have a standalone fuzzy library using a specify 
	  configuration file. It is now possible and consistent.
	
	* htlib/htString.cc: more constness where appropriate. Changed compare
	  to have const String& arg instead of const Object* because useless and
	  potential source of bugous code.

	* htfuzzy/Regex.cc (getWords): fix bugous setting of extra_word_chars
	  configuration value. It is set to change the behaviour of HtStripPunctuation
	  but this function get the extra_word_chars from a static array initialized
	  at program start by static void Initialize(Configuration & config). Use straight
	  s.remove() instead. Besides, the string was anchored by prepending a ^ that
	  was removed because part of the reserved chars.

Mon Sep 20 11:47:05 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htlib/Configuration.cc (operator []): changed return type to String
	  to solve memory leak. When char* the string was malloced from ParsedString
	  after substitution and never freed. In fact it was even worse : it was
	  free before use in some cases.

Sun Sep 19 19:12:44 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htdoc/cf_generate.pl, htcommon/defaults.cc, htlib/Configuration.h: 
	  Change the structure of the configuration defaults. Move
	  description, examples, types, used_by information from attrs.html.
	  Write cf_generate.pl to build attrs.html, cf_byname, cf_byprog
	  from defaults.cc. Makes it easier to maintain an up to date 
	  description of existing attributes. About 10 attributes existed
	  in defaults.cc and were not describted in the HTML pages. 
	  Add rules in htdoc/Makefile.am to generate the pages if a source
	  changes.

Fri Sep 17 19:34:48 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* Makefile.config: add -Wall to all compilation and fix
	  all resulting warnings.

	* htlib/Connection.cc (assign_server): remove redundant test
	  and cast litteral value to unsigned

	* htlib/String.cc: add const qualifier where possible. Helps
	  dealing with const objects at an upper level.

Fri Sep 17 18:27:57 1999  Alexander Bergolth  <leo at leo.wu-wien.ac.at>

	A few changes so that it compiles with xlC on AIX:

	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Remove word_list since that file is no
	longer used. 

	* htdig/htdig.cc: Ensure -a and -i are followed for the word_db
	file. Fixes PR #638.

Sat Sep 11 00:11:28 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	  object member. words.Close() at end of Start function
	  to make sure data is flushed by database.

	* htcommon/WordList.cc (Close): test isopen to prevent
	  ugly crash. Remove isopen test in calling functions.

Fri Sep 10 13:45:53 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* htcommon/WordList.h htcommon/WordList.cc: methods Collect
	  and Walk that factorise the behaviour of operator [], Prefix

	  to write an ascii version of a word.
	
	* htdig/htdig.cc: -t now also dump word database in ascii as
	  well.

	* htdoc/attrs.html,cf_byprog.html,cf_byname.html: added doc
	  for word_dump

Thu Sep  9 20:30:18 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htfuzzy/Fuzzy.h, htfuzzy/Fuzzy.cc, htfuzzy/Prefix.cc,
	htfuzzy/Regex.cc, htfuzzy/Speling.cc, htfuzzy/Substring.cc,
	htfuzzy/htfuzzy.cc, htfuzzy.h: Change to use WordList code instead

	* htdig/ExternalParser.h, htdig/ExternalParser.cc (parse): Change
	parsing of location to allow phrase searching -- location is *not*
	just 0-1000.

	* htdig/Plaintext.h, htdig/Plaintext.cc, htdig/PDF.cc: Ditto.

	* htdig/Retriever.h, htdig/Retriever.cc: Don't call
	HtStripPunctuation. This is now done in the WordList::Word method.
	
	* htcommon/WordList.h htcommon/WordList.cc (Prefix): New method to
	do prefix retrievals. Essentially the same as [], except the loop
	is broken only in the unlikely event that we retrieve something
	beyond the range set.
	(Exists): New method for checking the existance of a
	string--attempt to retrieve it and determine if anything's
	actually there.
	(Word): Call HtStripPunctuation as part of the cleanup.

Tue Sep  7 21:37:44 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>
	
	* htcommon/defaults.cc: Add new configuration option
	removed_unretrieved_urls to remove docs that have not been accessed.

	* htmerge/docs.cc (convertDocs): Use it.

	* htcommon/defaults.h, htcommon/WordRecord.h,
	htcommon/WordReference.h: Add copyright notice to head of file.

	(Open, Read): If the databases are
	already open, close them first in case we're opening under a
	different filename.
	(CreateSearchDB): Remove call to external
	sort program. Database is already sorted by DocID.

	* configure.in, configure: Remove check for external sort
	program. No longer necessary.

	* htcommon/DocumentDB.h: Ditto.
	
Sun Sep  5 01:37:27 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/WordList.cc(Flush): Call Add() instead of storing the
	data ourselves. Additionally, don't open the database ourself (and
	then close it), instead call Open() if it's not open already.

	* htcommon/DocumentRef.h, htcommon/DocumentRef.cc(AddDescription):
	Pass in a WordList to use when adding link text words. Ensures
	that the word db is never opened twice for writing.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc: Call AddDescription as above.

	* htdig/Server.cc(ctor): If debugging, write out an entry for the
	robots.txt file.

	* htlib/HtHeap.cc(percolateUp): Fix a bug where the parent was not
	updated when moving up more than once.
	(pushDownRoot): Fix a bug where the root was inproperly pushed
	down when it required looping.

Fri Sep  3 16:23:23 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htlib/HtHeap.cc(Remove): Correct bug where after a removal, the
	structure was not "re-heapified" correctly. The last item should
	be moved to the top and pushed down.
	(pushDownRoot): Don't move items past the size of the underlying
	array.
	
	* htdig/Server.h, htdig/Server.cc: Change _paths to work on a
	heap, based on the hopcount. Ensures on a given server that the
	indexing will be done in level-order by hopcount.

Wed Sep 01 15:40:37 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* test: implement minimal tests for htsearch and htdig

Tue Aug 31 02:17:04 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/WordRecord.h: Change back to struct to ensure integrity
	when compressed and stored in the word database.

	* htcommon/WordList.cc (Flush): Use HtPack to compress the
	WordRecord before storage.
	([], WordRefs): Use HtUnpack to decompress the WordRecord after
	storage.

Sun Aug 29 00:42:07 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (convertToBoolean): Remove debugging
	strings.

	* htsearch/parser.h: Add new method score(List) to merge scoring
	for both standard and phrase searching.

	* htsearch/parser.cc(phrase): Keep the current list of successful
	matched words around to pass to score and perform_phrase.
	(perform_phrase): Naively (and slowly, but correctly) loop through
	past words to make sure they match DocID as well as successive locations.
	Move scoring to score().
	(perform_push): Move scoring to score().
	(score): Loop through a list of WordReferences and create a list
	of scored DocMatches.

Sun Aug 29 00:33:17 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc(createLogicalWords): Hack to produce
	correct output with phrase searching (e.g. anything in quotes is
	essentially left alone). Ensure the StringMatch pattern includes
	the phrase with correct spacing as well.
	(setupWords): Add a " token whenever it occurs in the query.
	(convertToBoolean): Make sure booleans are not inserted into
	phrases.

	* htsearch/parser.h: Add new methods phrase and perfor_phrase to
	take care of parsing phrases and performing the actual matching.

	* htsearch/parser.cc(lexan): Return a '"' when present for phrase
	searching.
	(factor): Call phrase() before parsing a factor--phrases are the
	highest priority, so ("RedHat Linux" & Debian) ! Windows makes
	sense.
	(phrase): New method--slurps up the rest of a phrase and calls
	perform_phrase to do the matching.
	(perform_phrase): New method--currently just calls perform_and to
	give the simulation of a phrase match.
	
Sat Aug 28 15:57:53 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Server.h, htdig/Server.cc: Undo yesterdays change -- still
	very buggy and shouldn't be used yet.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (parse_url): Change default index to 1 to
	more closely match DocIDs shown with verbose output.

	* htsearch/DocMatch.h: Change score to double and clean up
	headers.

	* htcommon/WordRecord.h: Change unnecessary long ints (id and
	flags) to plain ints.

	* htdig/HTML.cc (parse): Call got_word with actual word sequence
	(i.e. 1, 2, 3...) rather than scaling to 1-1000 by character
	offset.

	* htlib/Database.h, htlib/DB2_db.h, htlib/DB2_hash.h: Change
	Get_Item to Get_Next(String item) to return the data as a
	reference. This makes it easier to use in a loop and cuts the
	database calls in half.

	* htlib/DB2_db.cc, htlib/DB2_hash.cc: Implement it, making sure we
	keep the possibly useful data around, rather than tossing it!

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc(htsearch): Don't attempt to open the word db
	ourselves. Instead, pass the filename off to the parser, which
	will do it through WordList.

	* htsearch/parser.h: Use a WordList instead of a generic Database.

	* htsearch/parser.cc(perform_push): Use the WordList[] operator to
	return a list of all matching WordRefs and loop through, summing
	the score.

	* htcommon/WordList.cc (Flush): Don't use HtPack on the
	data--somehow when unpacking, there's a mismatch of sizes.
	(Read): Fix thinko where we attempted to open the database as a
	DB_HASH.
	([]): Don't use HtUnpack since we get mismatches. Use the new
	Get_Next(data) call instead of calling Get_Item separately.
	(WordRefs): Same as above.
	
Fri Aug 27 09:44:09 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htdig/Retriever.cc (Need2Get): Remove duplicate detection code for
	local_urls. The code is somewhat buggy and should be replaced by
	more general code shortly.

	* htdig/Server.h, htdig/Server.cc (push, pop): Change _paths to a 
	HtHeap sorted on hopcount first (and order placed on heap
	second). Ensures that on each server, the order indexed is
	guaranteed to be level-order by hopcount.

	* htdig/URLRef.h, htdig/URLRef.cc (compare): Add comparison method
	to enable sorting by hopcount.
	
Fri Aug 27 09:36:35 1999  Geoff Hutchison <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htcommon/WordList.h, htcommon/WordList.cc (WordList): Change
	words to a list instead of a dictionary for minor speed improvement.

Thu Aug 26 11:18:20 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htcommon/defaults.cc, htdoc/attrs.html: increase default
	maximum_word_length to 32.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc(got_word): add code to check for compound words
	and add their component parts to the word database.
	* htdig/PDF.cc(parseString), htdig/Plaintext.cc(parse): Don't strip
	punctuation or lowercase the word before calling got_word.  That
	should be left up to got_word & Word methods.

	* htlib/StringMatch.h, htlib/StringMatch.cc(Pattern, IgnoreCase):
	Add an IgnorePunct() method, which allows matches to skip over valid
	punctuation, change Pattern() and IgnoreCase() to accomodate this.
	* htsearch/htsearch.cc(main, createLogicalWords): use IgnorePunct()
	to highlight matching words in excerpts regardless of punctuation,
	toss out old origPattern, and don't add short or bad words to
	logicalPattern.

	* htlib/HtWordType.h, htlib/HtWordType.cc(Initialize): set up and
	use a lookup table to speed up HtIsWordChar() and HtIsStrictWordChar().

Mon Aug 23 10:13:05 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/HTML.cc(parse): fix problems with null pointer when attempting
	SGML entity decoding on bare &, as reported by Vadim Chekan.

Thu Aug 19 11:52:06 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	input parameter definitions.

	* contrib/parse_doc.pl: make spaces optional in LANGUAGE = POSTSCRIPT
	PJL test.

Wed Aug 18 11:27:46 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/PDF.cc(parse): Fixed wrong variable name in new code.
	Double-Oops!  (It was Friday the 13th, after all...)

Tue Aug 17 16:26:46 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/HtHeap.cc(Remove): apply Geoff's patch to fix Remove.

	* htlib/HtVector.h, htlib/HtVector.cc(Index): various bounds overrun
	bug fixes and checking in Last(), Nth() & Index().

Mon Aug 16 13:55:10 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc(expandVariables): fix up test for &amp;

Mon Aug 16 12:08:57 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* Makefine.am, Makefile.in, installdir/Makefile.am,
	installdir/Makefile.in: change all remaining INSTALL_ROOT to DESTDIR.

Fri Aug 13 15:44:31 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/PDF.cc(parse): added missing ')' in new code.  Oops!

	* htlib/strptime.c, htlib/mktime.c: added #include "htconfig.h"
	to pick up definitions from configure program. Let's try to
	remember that config.h != htconfig.h!

Fri Aug 13 14:49:07 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* configure.in: removed unused HTDIG_TOP, changed AM_WITH_ZLIB
	  by CHECK_ZLIB

Fri Aug 13 14:00:16 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/PDF.cc(parse), htcommon/defaults.cc, htdoc/attrs.html
	(pdf_parser): Removed -pairs option from default arguments, added
	special test for acroread to decide whether to use output file or
	directory as last argument (also adds -toPostScript if missing).
	Program now tries to test for existance of parser before trying
	to call it.

Fri Aug 13 10:10:16 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdoc/attrs.html(pdf_parser): updated xpdf version number.

Thu Aug 12 17:09:37 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

Thu Aug 12 11:21:12 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* strptime fixes : AC_FUNC_STRPTIME defined in acinclude.m4 and used in configure.in,
	  conditional compilation of strptime.c (only if HAVE_STRPTIME not defined),
	  removed Htstrptime (strptime.c now defines strptime), changed all calls to Htstrptime
	  to calls to strptime.

Wed Aug 11 16:59:41 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at ceic.com>

	* */Makefile.am: use -release instead of -version-info because nobody
	  wants to bother with published shared lib interfaces version numbers
	  at present.

	* htlib/Makefile.am: added langinfo.h

Wed Aug 11 15:00:07 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

Wed Aug 11 13:46:22 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* configure.in: change --enable-test to --enable-tests so
	  that Berkeley DB tests are not activated. Since they depend
	  on tcl this can be a pain.

	* acinclude.m4: AM_PROG_TIME locate time command + find out
	  if verbose output is -l (freebsd) or -v (linux)

Wed Aug 11 13:13:39 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* acinclude.m4 : AM_WITH_ZLIB autoconf macro for zlib detection that
	  allows --with-zlib=DIR to specify the install root of zlib, 
	  --without-zlib to prevent inclusion of zlib. If nothing 
	  specified zlib is searched in /usr and /usr/local.
	  --disable-zlib is replaced with --without-zlib.

	* configure.in,configure,aclocal.m4,db/dist/acinclude.m4,
	  db/dist/aclocal.m4,db/dist/configure,db/dist/configure.in:
	  changed to use AM_WITH_ZLIB

Tue Aug 10 21:14:34 1999  Geoff Hutchison  <ghutchis at wso.williams.edu>

	* htsearch/Display.cc (outputVariable): Fix compilation error with
	assignment between char * and char *.

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc (main): Use cleaner trick to sidestep
	discarding const char * as suggested by Gilles.

Tue Aug 10 17:24:12 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc(expandVariables): clean up, simplify and
	label lexical analyzer states.

Tue Aug 10 17:04:54 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htsearch/Display.cc(expandVariables, outputVariable): add handling
	for $%(var) and $&(var) in templates.  Still to be documented.

Tue Aug 10 20:13:52 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* db/mp/mp_bh.c: fixed HAVE_ZLIB -> HAVE_LIBZ

Tue Aug 10 17:58:01 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* configure,configure.in,db/dist/configure.in,db/dist/configure:
	  added --with-zlib configure flag for htdig to specify zlib 
	  installation path. Motivated to have compatible tests between
	  htdig and db as far as zlib is concerned. Otherwise configuration
	  is confused and miss an existing libz.

Tue Aug 10 17:44:49 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* db/mp/mp_fopen.c: fixed cmpr_open called even if libz not here

Tue Aug 10 17:40:53 1999  Loic Dachary  <loic at yoda.ceic.com>

	* htlib/langinfo.h: header missing on FreeBSD-3.2, needed
	  by strptime.c

	* htdig/Transport.h(GetRequestMaxDocumentSize): Fix declaration to
	return int.

	* htdig/Retriever.cc(got_href): Fix mistake in hopcount
	calculations. Now returns the correct hopcount even for pages
	when a faster path is found. (Still need to change indexing to
	sort on hopcount).

	* htsearch/htsearch.cc(main): Fix compiler error in gcc-2.95 when
	discarding const by using strcpy. It's a hack, hopefully there's a
	better way.

Mon Aug  9 17:23:15 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htlib/URL.cc(ServerAlias): fix small memory leak in new default
	path code (don't need to allocate new from string each time).

	* htlib/cgi.cc(init): Fix PR#572, where htsearch crashed if
	CONTENT_LENGTH was not set but REQUEST_METHOD was.

	* htfuzzy/Fuzzy.cc(getWords), htfuzzy/Metaphone.cc(vscode):
	Fix Geoff's change of May 15 to Fuzzy.cc, add test to vscode macro
	to stay in array bounds, so non-ASCII letters to cause segfault.
	Should fix PR#514.

Mon Aug  9 17:03:45 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* include/htconfig.h.in, htcommon/WordList.cc(Word,Flush&BadWordFile),
	htcommon/DocumentRef.cc(AddDescription), htcommon/defaults.cc,
	htsearch/parser.cc(perform_push), htdoc/attrs.html,
	htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:
	Convert the MAX_WORD_LENGTH compile-time option into the run-time
	configuration attribute maximum_word_length.  This required reinserting
	word truncation code that had been taken out of WordList.cc.

Mon Aug  9 16:34:14 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdig/HtHTTP.cc (isParsable): allow application/pdf as parsable,
	to use builtin PDF code. 

	* htdig/HtHTTP.cc (ParseHeader),
	htdig/Document.cc (readHeader): clean up header parsing.

	* htdig/Document.cc (getdate): make tm static, so it's initialized
	to zeros.  Should fix PR#81 & PR#472, where strftime() would crash
	on some systems.  Idea submitted by benoit.sibaud at cnet.francetelecom.fr

	* htlib/URL.cc (parse): fix PR#348, to make sure a missing or invalid
	port number will get set correctly.

Mon Aug  9 15:42:41 1999  Gilles Detillieux  <grdetil at scrc.umanitoba.ca>

	* htdoc/attrs.html, htdoc/cf_byname.html, htdoc/cf_byprog.html:
	Added descriptions for attributes that were missing, added a few
	clarifications, and corrected a few defaults and typos.
	Covers PR#558, PR#626, and then some.

	the list of documents deleted.

	* htmerge/docs.cc: Update for difference in calling order.

	* htmerge/words.cc: Update (and significant cleanup) since
	WordList writes directly to db.words.db. Iterate over the stored
	words, deleting those from deleted documents.

	defined in htcommon/WordRecord.h.

	  standard).
	  database : var/htdig
	  programs : bin
	  libraries : lib
	  
	  Like default apache:
	  conf : conf
	  htdocs : htdocs/htdig
	  cgi-bin : cgi-bin

	* Switch all Makefile.in into Makefile.am

	* CONFIG.in CONFIG : removed. Replaced with --with- arguments in
	  configure.in

	* Makefile.config.in removed, only keep Makefile.config : automake
	  automatically defines variables for each AC_SUBST variables. 
	  Makefile.config has HTLIBS + DEFINES

	* db/Makefile : added to forward (clean all distclean) targets to
	  db/dist and implement distdir target.

	* acconfig.h : created to allow autoheader to work (contains GETPEERNAME_LENGTH_T
	  HAVE_BOOL, HAVE_TRUE, HAVE_FALSE, NEED_PROTO_GETHOSTNAME). Extra definitions
	  added before @TOP@ (TRUE, FALSE, VERSION, MAX_WORD_LENGTH, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FACILITY).

	* installdir/Makefile.am : installation rules moved from Makefile.am to installdir/Makefile.am

	* include/Makefile.am : distribute htconfig.h.in and stamp-h.in
	
	* Makefile.am : do not pre-create the directories, creation is done during the installation
	
	* configure.in: CF_MAKE_INCLUDE not needed anymore : automake handles
	  the include itself.
